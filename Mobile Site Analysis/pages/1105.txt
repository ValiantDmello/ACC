A device that has set the tone in mobile since it first launched, it is the metric from which all other handsets are measured. With an advanced mobile operating system in iOS, and the App Store, an iPhone is capable of delivering a wealth of communication and connectivity. An evolutionary path When Apple first launched the iPhone back in 2007, it revolutionized what a smartphone could be. The App Store that followed in 2008 took the device to another level, transforming mobile connectivity and capability in incredible ways. From the 3.5-inch LCD displays of the first few years to the beautifully big, high resolution OLED displays you see in the latest models, the iPhone has physically grown in its dimensions, while also gaining in sophistication and stature along the way. A full lineup to choose from From only one device a decade ago, there are now a half dozen iPhone models to choose from. Go big, bold, and premium while enjoying the ultimate in mobile photography with the iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max. The powerful iPhone 12 features dual cameras and an OLED display. The budget-friendly iPhone 11 and iPhone XR offer 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD displays, so you can go big without breaking the bank. The iPhone SE is the ultimate in affordable iPhones, made for those who prefer the more traditional 4.7-inch display. Or, go super small with the all-new iPhone 12 Mini. This compact new device packs all the power of the iPhone 12 and a 5.4-inch OLED display into a smartphone that’s even smaller than the iPhone SE. Ultra-big or super compact, the entire iPhone 12 series features the latest technology, including 5G cellular, Wi-Fi 6, OLED Super Retina XDR displays, Face ID, and the powerful new A14 Bionic processor. Choose the colour you want and make your iPhone a reflection of your taste. The options available vary based on the model you select. For example, premium options of Pacific Blue, Gold, Graphite or Silver are exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Blue, Green, (Product) Red, White or Black are offered for the iPhone 12. Whatever colour you choose adds flair to a device that already has plenty of it on its own. The power of iOS The face of the iPhone, iOS is an advanced mobile platform that allows the device to do amazing things. There are millions of apps to choose from and more games than you can imagine. Best-in-class security. Plenty of ways to help your phone do more. Message and video chat with anyone in the world, shoot photos and video at the touch of a button, and control smart devices at home and abroad. Tap the power of Siri, Apple’s voice-powered digital assistant. Listen to music, no matter whether you download or stream it, and take your tunes with you on the go. Play your hits or favourite podcasts in the comfort of home, streaming to wireless speakers over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Play back video from your device to your TV through an Apple TV, or over AirPlay 2. Accessorize it your way There is no shortage of options to personalize or enhance your iPhone. Put a case on it for a new look or serious protection. Stick a screen protector to save it from scratches. Give your battery a boost with a portable charger you can take with you, or try a wireless charging pad or dock for true wire-free convenience. Apple has a new option in the MagSafe case and MagSafe wireless charger for iPhones. Pick up another cable you can use to charge in the car or at work. Add a pair of wireless earbuds like AirPods Pro. iPhone: ﻿The smartphone that changed the game The iPhone is probably the most iconic smartphone in the world.
