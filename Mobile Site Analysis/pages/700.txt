Read more Driving innovation for over 50 years, Intel is at the centre of your computing life Intel computer processors on your desktop The world’s most popular desktop PC processors are Intel Core CPUs, by a wide margin. And there’s a good reason for that. At home, in the office, or in a data centre, Intel computers are known for offering best-in-class performance, value and compatibility. From the most powerful, multi-core Intel 8th generation and 9th generation processors to the mighty Xeon and the affordable Celeron, Intel processors offer everything needed to make an outstanding modern PC. Intel Core processors are at the heart of a mobile computing revolution Few areas in the computing world have evolved so quickly and dramatically as mobile, and Intel Core mobile processors are enabling the revolution. Ultra-thin form factors, convertible and 2-in-1 laptops, Windows tablets, 4K displays, dual displays, ultra-fast 802.11ac wireless, and day-long battery life are all made possible by the latest generation of mobile Intel Core processors. It took a huge leap forward for this new era of shape-shifting, powerful, multimedia-friendly and ultra-portable PC laptops to be developed. Intel computer innovations including Intel Optane memory, Thunderbolt 3, Intel Wireless-AC and integrated 4K video support all helped to make this new era of mobile computing possible, by combining cutting edge on-chip capabilities with superior performance and unbeatable energy efficiency. Choose Intel i7 processors for blazing PC gaming performance Whether you’re talking desktop or mobile, serious PC gamers know to look for an Intel computer for the best possible performance. The ninth generation of Intel Core processors are a must-have for today’s incredibly immersive—and incredibly demanding—AAA video games. Look for up to eight cores of performance at the heart of a new Intel based PC. In addition Intel’s latest processors include integrated support for advanced technology like Thunderbolt 3 (with the bandwidth to connect 4K displays or even external GPUs for more graphics horsepower), Intel Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) for up to 75% lower wireless latency, and the option to easily overclock desktop gaming PCs. Even the best e-sports athlete is only as good as their gaming rig, and with a mobile or desktop gaming PC equipped with the latest Intel i7 processor, they can count on their equipment delivering performance that’s a perfect complement to their skills. Intel Optane memory accelerates PC performance Intel is always developing exciting new technology that can boost PC performance. Intel Optane memory is a new class of memory modules that use 3D NAND fabrication technology to achieve super low latency. Intel Optane memory acts as a cache between system RAM and storage, accelerating day-to-day processes like accessing frequently used files. Added to PCs with 7th or 8th generation Intel processors, overall system performance can be increased by 28%, with everyday tasks doubling in speed—even when equipped with a hard disk drive instead of an SSD. Whether you use a PC to surf the web, watch streaming video, catch up on work, or dominate at video games, you’ll get the best results choosing an Intel computer as your next laptop or desktop PC.
