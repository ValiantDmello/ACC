Bose Headphones Bose offers a wide selection of headphones and earbuds to suit different listening needs. Wireless over-ear noise-cancelling headphones that fully encompass you in the music and block out ambient noise are ideal for commuters, private listening, or when traveling by plane or train. Meanwhile, sports earbuds, including small, unobtrusive true wireless earbuds in finishes like black and orange, fit securely into your ears for private listening while at the gym, or engaging in physical activity. They are sweat- and weather-resistant and come with a charging case. Bose headphones and earbuds include features like long battery life, built-in mics for making and receiving phone calls, and compatibility with the Bose Connect app, which you can use to manage multiple Bluetooth device connections. There’s also the innovative sleepbuds, which are designed to mask ambient sounds while also delivering soothing sounds to help you fall asleep, selected through the Bose Sleep app. You can even set a wake-up alarm that won’t disturb others sleeping in the home or the same bed. They’re perfect for couples where one person works shifts and tends to get up very early, or for anyone who has trouble falling asleep. They come in colours like black and rose gold. You don’t even need to pop anything into or over your ears to get sound through Bose: the company also offers products like the SoundWear behind-the-neck device that envelops you in sound while minimizing what others around you can hear; as well as Bluetooth audio sunglasses that play music directly from the frames, and include an integrated mic. For all-day wear, these options allow you to listen (and talk) while keeping your ears completely free. Bose Speakers Bose speakers include portable Bluetooth and rugged models that you can clip to a keychain or backpack for outdoor listening while out and about on adventures, to wireless multi-room speakers for the home. Some Bose Bluetooth speakers are fully waterproof, others splash-proof and compatible with NFC for tap-and-connect. Some larger ones come with handles, making transport from room to room or from inside to out easy. Finish options for the micro rugged waterproof portable Bluetooth speakers range from basics like black to bright and flashy colours like yellow, red, and light blue. At home, there are wireless multi-room speakers that work with the Bose SoundTouch app for accessing streaming music services, and using your mobile device as a remote. Other Home speakers are smart speakers that can be controlled by voice using both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, and/or an app. Additionally, Bose offers multimedia speakers for use with a computer. Available in pairs, they can enhance the experience while you watch videos, play games, and more. Bose Home Theatre To enhance your home theatre set-up, Bose has a myriad of options, including single-piece soundbars, soundbars with subwoofers, surround speakers, bookshelf speakers, and subwoofers. Get an entire system, speakers in pairs, or individual ones. A single-piece Bose soundbar can connect to the TV via a single cable and provide enhanced audio, including Dialogue mode that makes speech more intelligible. They also include Bluetooth for streaming music to the device. Bose also offers full 5.1 speaker systems that include four cube speakers and a horizontal centre channel for a fully immersive audio experience in the living room as you watch movies, sports, or binge-watch series. Pair it with an AV receiver, and use the adjustable controls to regulate volume. Additionally, Bose makes wall mounts and brackets for a seamless set-up of speakers; as well as recording and DJ equipment for professionals.
