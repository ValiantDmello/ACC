One of the most recent innovations in both of these areas is the advent of the curved screen. Between reducing glare and distortion over long periods and providing improved viewing angles that increase the sensation of immersion, Curved Monitors have a lot to offer for PC users. Key benefits of curved monitors First and foremost, the primary function of a curved computer monitor is to deliver the most immersive and enjoyable experience possible. Curved monitors achieve this in a few different ways. Firstly, they eliminate the distortion that can cause images to appear blurry. Whereas flat screen monitors project their images straight forward, a curved screen monitor uses its shape to its advantage—directing everything toward the viewer and causing a 3D-like sensation. When you think about it, the world around us isn’t “flat” either. So when a screen takes on a curved shape, it does a better job of simulating what it feels like to actually view the three dimensional world around us! Curved monitors also generate a wider field of view. Again, the advantage here lies in the way a curved screen monitor aims images directly at the viewer, which means that the eye doesn’t have to travel as far to see more of the screen. The result is a greater sense of immersion—one that will also make the monitor itself appear larger. Curved monitors for entertainment and productivity As you can likely imagine, a curved monitor screen is a great choice for gaming, watching movies and videos, and much more. The reduction in distortion and blurry images is a key advantage among those looking for the most compelling and immersive gaming time, or for an engrossing cinematic experience with the latest blockbuster films and TV shows. In fact, many curved monitors are built specifically for gaming and entertainment—incorporating other important features such as 4K resolution, low response times, ultrawide picture formats, and more. The benefits of a curved screen are not limited solely to fun and games however. They can do wonders for everyday tasks and productivity as well. Since the curved shape allows the human eye to take in more of the screen while travelling less distance, this ultimately leads to less eye strain overall. By generating a wider field of view that allows users to take in everything at once, the experience will feel more natural, and therefore lead to increased comfort (and increased productivity) over time. Other features of curved monitors The growing popularity of curved screen monitors means that there is a variety of different options available for consumers, many with unique innovations that create an even more impressive video display. 4K curved monitors offer incredibly high resolution, while ultrawide screens give users copious amounts of real estate to work with. Furthermore, frameless curved screen monitors introduce a remarkably thin bezel, leading to minimal distraction. A thin bezel also comes in handy if you intend to link more than one curved monitor together in a dual monitor setup. With the ability to link together two or more highly-immersive curved monitors together, the potential results can be remarkable! Want more info?
