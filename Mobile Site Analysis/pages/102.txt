Memory cards and flash storage capture and store critical data every time you press a camera shutter or transfer over a document. And if any of those files happen to be MP3s, there’s a music player ready to serenade your ears. SanDisk memory cards SanDisk has been helping people make memories for a long time through memory cards that preserve lasting images. Whether capturing images with a digital camera or smartphone, a memory card keeps them handy and safe for whenever you need to see or share them. The SanDisk SD, microSD and CompactFlash memory card selection provides something for everyone. It’s not just a matter of capacity but also one of compatibility. These cards work on a variety of devices, be they computers, cameras, smartphones, music players, dash cams, game consoles, streaming boxes and more. If you have a device in need of a memory card, SanDisk has one that will fit right in. You can find the storage size you need, starting as low as 16GB to as high as 400GB, with different speeds to accommodate devices that could use the extra zip. Ultra and Extreme Pro cards are ideal for DSLR and mirrorless cameras where writing speed makes it easier to capture photos quickly. Ultra Plus and Extreme memory cards can provide fast speeds, even at lower capacities, making them truly utilitarian parts of any device where storage is important. The SanDisk family of memory cards ensure you don’t have to worry about losing precious data, like photos and videos. If your device can take an SD or microSD HC (high capacity) or XC (extra capacity), then SanDisk has you covered. SanDisk storage drives Storage comes in different forms, and SanDisk has a long history of providing those solutions. There are flash drives you can slide into a USB port on a computer or mobile device, like a smartphone or tablet. You can also upgrade your computer’s internal storage by replacing it with a SATA solid state drive (SSD). Flash drives are small and easy to carry anywhere, coming in various storage sizes to handle the necessary amount of data. There is a wide array of capacities available to serve the storage needs of the casual or power user. It’s easy to just slide them into a Windows PC or Apple Mac computer and copy or transfer important files with a simple and drag-and-drop sequence. Small thumb-size flash drives utilize the speed of USB 3.0 or 3.1 to speed up those transfers. Special flash drives that fit Apple’s Lightning port can expand the capacity of your iPhone or iPad from 16GB to 128GB. SanDisk also offers larger storage options for both external and internal uses. You can go big with a 500GB or 1TB SSD to take with you anywhere, or give your PC new life with a brand new SATA drive to expand its capacity to new heights. SanDisk music players Listening to MP3 music files on the go is easy to manage when taking any of the small music players along for a commute. Simple and user-friendly, these players also have screens to help navigate and organize tracks and playlists to suit your musical tastes. Plug in your favourite headphones and rock on to the tunes you want to listen to. SanDisk music players are compatible with all MP3 files, holding thousands of songs. Take your very own music library with you, without worrying about data or subscription fees. When listening to music on these players, it’s always on your own terms. There’s no need to fret over your important files when you have a trusty SanDisk memory card or storage drive to keep them safe everywhere you go.
