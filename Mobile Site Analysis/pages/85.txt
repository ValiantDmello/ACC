This is still a unique phone by any standard, even among the few foldable devices currently available. Back again is the 1.9-inch Cover Screen Super AMOLED, the window into the device itself, letting you see notifications and app widgets before you even flip the phone open.¹ This screen serves more than one purpose when you utilize it to frame yourself for high-quality selfies using the rear camera. Opening the phone up reveals the 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display with an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate for smoother navigation. Made with smoother glass that also stands tough, the Flip4 will handle the rigours of your daily routine. Don’t fret if it ends up taking a brief dip in water, thanks to the IPX8 water resistance.² The Galaxy Flip4 will fit in just fine at the pool when you want to take a quick snap or video in the water. Flexing with the Flip4 Samsung is also bringing back the Flex mode that makes the Flip4 unique as a functional screen. Propping it up at an angle lets you make use of various apps without holding the phone in your hands.³ Stream a soccer or hockey game on the top half of the screen and use the Multi window to browse a website or message someone on the bottom half.⁴ Watch a YouTube video on the top half, while looking at what to watch next on the lower half. Even though not all apps are optimized to work this way, Samsung does the work to make it happen, letting you get more out of Flex mode. That includes photos, where you can capture what you want from both sides. Place the phone down on a flat surface to either shoot a great scene in front of you or do a video call keeping your hands free. When you clamp the phone shut, the Cover Screen shows you what the rear camera sees, simplifying how you capture selfies for you and friends and family, leaving no one out of frame. Camera creativity The Cover Screen already gives you flexibility on how to capture yourself, but the Flip4’s design offers much more. Get creative by capturing low-light and nighttime scenes by just laying it down somewhere and pressing the shutter button to snap a photo. Bend the lower half just enough for a better grip, turning the phone into a camcorder for smoother video capture. The flexible hinge lets you photograph or record subjects from a variety of angles, like a worm’s-eye view of a building or tower. If you can think of it, there’s a good chance the Galaxy Flip4 can probably see it from that vantage point. Wielding some power A flexible hinge doesn’t have to come with compromises everywhere. The Galaxy Z Flip4 runs on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 octa-core processor, whose 4nm process makes it a fast mover when it comes to getting things done. You also get 8GB of RAM, along with your choice of 128GB or 256GB of internal storage. The Galaxy Flip4 is also ready to go with support for 5G connectivity, as well as Wi-Fi 6, for the fastest connections at home and away. That way, you can always access any device compatible with Samsung SmartThings or smart home products in your connected home. Product disclaimer ¹Certain applications may not be supported on the Cover Screen. ²Phone can spend up to 30 minutes in 1.5 meters of water. ³Flex Mode supported at angles between 75° and 115°. For your convenience, it may be difficult to maintain Flex Mode while moving due to shaking or other movement. It is recommended to keep the phone stationary while in Flex Mode. ⁴Certain applications may not support Multi-window view.
