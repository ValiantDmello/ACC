In many ways Jaybird was one of the first manufacturers to produce small, sweatproof, wireless Bluetooth headphones that incorporated innovative in-ear fit technology to help keep them in place during vigorous exercise. Since their first product launched in 2007, they’ve continued to improve on the design and functionality, and this history and experience has kept them at the head of the pack when it comes to sports headphones. Sport Headphones There are a few really important features that combine to make sports headphones not just appropriate, but ideal for sweaty pursuits. Secure Fit Many models of sports headphones offer different takes on the “secure fit” but Jaybird has always incorporated innovative materials, designs, and approaches to keeping their buds in your ears while you move. One of the most successful methods is the ear cushion which can vary in appearance, but typically fits into the concha cymba, better known as the swirly bit, right above your ear canal. The combination of the ear cushion and the earbud which fits into the ear canal using different sized cups keeps your Jaybirds seated in just the right spot to deliver great sound. Sweat, Water, and Dust Proofing The last thing you want is for sweat to permeate the nooks and crannies of your headphones and kill the music just as you’re dialing into the zone. Many of Jaybird’s headphones models offer IPX7 ratings, which mean they’ll hold up to sweat and dust no problem and can even be submerged in up to 1 metre of water for up to 30 minutes. Basically, you could do your full workout, sweating as much as you want, and then walk right into the shower and rinse off without so much as touching the pause button. Bluetooth range Often in the gym, it’s helpful to be able to start a playlist and then leave your phone in one place while you complete your sets or run on the treadmill. Being able to control your music and move around freely without the annoyance of skips or pauses in your music is key. Many of Jaybird’s designs feature a cord that connects the two earphones, but also contains an antenna that improves the connectivity as your phone moves from one side of your body to the other. In their true wireless earbuds, Bluetooth 5.0 technology keeps the connection strong as well even without the wires. True Wireless In-Ear Headphones For the ultimate in audio freedom, true wireless headphones are the gold standard and Jaybird has been honing its designs for years to deliver the best. With features like submersible IPX7 waterproofing, capacitive touch controls, 6 hours of battery life with 10 extra hours in the carrying case, quick charge, and multiple secure fit design elements; Jaybird’s true wireless headphones are among some of the best in the business.
