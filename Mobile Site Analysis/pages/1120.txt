As a heritage brand that’s been around for more than 100 years, Samsonite focuses on two things: craftsmanship and heritage. Each piece is designed to last, but also to feature innovative technologies that spur the brand forward. Samsonite Canada opened in 1956 in Stratford, Ontario, producing a multitude of products for the Canadian consumer. Samsonite Hard Side Luggage Sets Right now, Samsonite’s biggest category is hard side luggage sets—and for good reason. These pieces are durable and roomy, and are an absolute steal when purchased as a set. Hard side luggage helps protect your belongings from being tossed from conveyor belt, to plane, and back, and often gives you slightly more space in the interior of your luggage set compared to a soft side case. Samsonite suitcases come in a variety of different colours and finishes, which makes them perfect for both checked and carry-on luggage. They’re easy to spot at luggage reclaim, but fit smoothly into the overhead bins, too. Look for sets with expandable features, especially in their medium and large checked sizes, for longer trips. (Samsonite offers plenty of options!) One thing that’s important to note about Samsonite is that they have two different technologies that they use for their wheels. Some Samsonite luggage sets feature a double-wheel design, which leaves you with eight wheels on each piece in total. Others have a simple, single-wheel design. However, both maintain a 360-degree spinner wheel design, so most users won’t notice a big difference between the two. If you’re really picky about the way that your luggage rolls, simply make sure to check the product photo and description to see which one is used in the set that you have your eye on—there’s likely a comparable option with the other wheels, too. Samsonite Soft Side Luggage For traditionalists, Samsonite continues to make quite a few models of soft side luggage available. Soft side luggage has fallen slightly out of favour over the years, but it’s great for anyone who always ends up throwing in “one last thing!” These pieces have zippered pockets on their exterior, which let you store things like travel itineraries or charging cords for easy access. They’re also slower to scuff than hard side luggage, so while they may show their age more at the ten-year mark, they frequently look pristine for longer. Samsonite Backpacks and Laptop Bags While Samsonite luggage is great for travelling (and Samsonite luggage on sale is great for your wallet), the brand’s portfolio doesn’t stop at long-distance explorations. They also offer excellent options for commutes within the city limits. Samsonite backpacks and laptop bags are a great choice for travelling to school and work. They’re durable and well-made, with ample padding. Many styles feature Samsonite’s high denier ballistic polyester, which is a technology that’s favoured by the brand for its sleek finish and incredibly durability. Samsonite bags are made for the everyday techie, if you will; they have simple silhouettes, separate laptop compartments, and lots of cushy padding. If you’re on the market for a new luggage set or everyday bag, make sure to check out Samsonite’s offerings for something that’ll last you for years.
