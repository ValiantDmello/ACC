It maintains the same vivid look you would expect from a high-end handset, and brings some of the other features to go with it. The Quad HD+ resolution only makes everything look better. The Adaptive 120Hz Display returns, automatically adjusting the refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz to save battery life. It’s still very bright, and has the same HDR10+ support to make video and photos look better. It’s also among the first phones powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, a new chipset that promises faster and smoother performance. With different options for storage and memory, you have choices to make because there is no memory card slot to expand storage any further. A place for the S Pen Unlike the previous Galaxy S21 Ultra, the S Pen doesn’t come sold separately with the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Much like the Galaxy Note phones of the past, the pen has its own holster at the bottom, where you can slide it out by just clicking it open. Of the entire Galaxy S22 line of phones, the Ultra is the only one that includes and is compatible with the S Pen. Samsung improved the pen’s performance by slashing the latency in half from the previous 5.6 milliseconds to 2.8 milliseconds. When you write down notes or draw images on the screen, it should feel smoother and more precise each time. You can also use the pen on the Galaxy Tab S8 tablets, as well as the Galaxy S21 Ultra, though only devices supporting the faster latency will give you the same results. Ultra camera-ready Samsung placed four lenses on the rear camera array, with a wide, ultra-wide, telephoto and longer telephoto making up the balance. The main camera sports a large 108-megapixel image sensor that Samsung says has improved even more to include better quality images at full resolution in low-light and at night. On the software side, Samsung developed new features, like Advanced Nightography, to make photos and video clearer at all times with both the rear and front cameras. What can help is the newer Super Clear Glass lens to bring in more light that also works when shooting video at night. A newer Auto Framing feature lets you capture more people in a frame, and even follow them as they re-enter the scene. The Galaxy S22 Ultra introduces a new app called Expert RAW that takes the photos you shoot in RAW in Pro mode and lets you edit them with more comprehensive tools to work with. Shooting in RAW on this phone means you can save in 16-bit HDR, where you can be more precise with how you edit—much like you would with a DSLR photo.
