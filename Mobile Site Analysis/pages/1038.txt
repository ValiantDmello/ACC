A wired router connects to each device through a Local Area Network (LAN) port, using an Ethernet cable that can carry data at very high speeds. A typical router will have four LAN ports, and one Wide Area Network (WAN) port, which connects to your existing broadband modem, i.e. the internet, also via an Ethernet cable. Advantages and Differences versus a Wireless Router A wired router offers a potentially faster, more reliable and secure connection, at a lower cost than comparable wireless routers. This is of particular benefit to businesses that need to share large files or sensitive information on a network. It's also appealing to gamers who value a consistent connection, unaffected by interference from weather, walls, or other wireless signals. The inherent restriction is that you cannot share your internet connection with wireless devices like tablets or smart phones, like you can with a wireless router. Features to Look For with a Wired Router The best wired router to look for is one that one that fully exploits its potential for speed and security. In addition to the basics, like an adequate number of LAN ports for your needs, look for security features like a built-in firewall, ping blocking, and port forwarding. Consider convenient features like remote management and VPN capability, so you can change your router settings and access your network from an internet connection while away. To get the fastest possible data speeds, your router should support Gigabit Ethernet, capable of transferring at a rate of a gigabit per second, ten times faster than the 100 megabits per second offered by standard Ethernet connections.
