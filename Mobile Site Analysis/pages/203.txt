The brand’s ethos is simple: “Better Starts Now.” But despite their forward-thinking technology, one of the big factors in what makes Citizen watches so popular is their link to the past. With over 100 years of experience in watchmaking, Citizen quartz watches have a balanced design, classic silhouette, and sturdy workmanship that keep them at the top of the field. Go from Day to Night with Citizen Men’s Watches Like many heritage brands, Citizen built its watchmaking empire on designing watches for the man of the household. It continues its legacy by offering a wide selection of men’s watches at an accessible luxury price point. Each watch is enriched with Citizen technologies from the past century, with enduring styles like the Citizen Promaster, Citizen Navihawk, and Citizen Axiom. These keystone styles are updated regularly with the newest technologies, and are available with different options for variations and accent features. Look for a simple titanium watch for something that blends in, or seek out a style like the Navihawk for world time with atomic clock synchronization. Keep it Classic with Citizen Ladies Watches If you’re looking to add a bit of class to your everyday outfit, a Citizen gold watch is a great place to start. The brand focuses on slim silhouettes with precious metal bracelets for their women’s collection. Gold and silver give the most timeless of looks, but rose gold is a beautiful way to add a modern twist to any classic piece. Classic Citizen embellishments include mother of pearl watch faces and Swarovski crystal accents. These watches are designed to appeal to the “everywoman,” so they’re easy to dress up or dress down—and the brand’s mixed-metals pieces are perfect for anyone who alternates between gold and silver jewellery. A Smarter Watch With a mission statement like “Better Starts Now,” it’s not surprising that Citizen reaches forward as a brand. Some of the best Citizen watches to launch in the last decade have been led by technology: we’re talking solar-powered, eco-friendly, and water-resistant watches. Developed for over 40 years, Citizen’s Eco-Drive collection features Citizen analog quartz watches powered by light. These models never need a new battery, and never need to be plugged in—unlike the fancy new smartwatch that you have your eye on. Look for Eco-Drive models with a power reserve indicator for next-level eco-friendly results. If you’re looking for a great timepiece, it’s easy to find something that suits your needs from any brand. But for something truly timeless, look to Citizen.
