Your computer or laptop looks like a single device, but it’s made up of dozens of components and PC parts. They all work together to provide the functionality you take for granted. Many of these can be replaced or upgraded, especially in the case of a desktop PC, and that’s a good thing. Occasionally, a PC part will fail. Sometimes a brand-new function will be available, so long as you install the new component. And many components can be upgraded, to keep your computer performing with the capabilities of a new PC. New computer parts mean keeping your PC running for longer, saving you the much larger expense of buying a new one. When it comes to finding those computer parts, Canada has a huge resource in the selection at Best Buy. What computer parts are key to improving performance and functionality? There are a number of components that can improve your PC’s performance, enhance functionality—or both. For both laptops and desktop computers, RAM is important for keeping your system humming, running memory-intensive applications, and keeping multiple apps and windows open simultaneously. Both benefit from storage, such as an SSD or HDD. A new SSD is one of the most popular computer parts Canada opts for, because the switch to solid state storage speeds up system operation considerable while also boosting storage capacity. With a desktop PC, there are other critical components. A new processor will boost performance across the board. A new graphics card means greatly improved graphics and video processing—critical for video gaming, VR, editing 4K video, and other activities. Stuck with outdated and slow Wi-Fi? A new 802.11ac Wi-Fi card is the answer, and it’s easy to install. There are other computer supplies to upgrade the capabilities of your PC, such as additional storage drives, an optical drive, or a sound card. A new power supply may be called for to ensure your PC can accommodate the electrical requirements of upgraded components (especially video cards). How do you know if your computer can benefit from a PC part? Generally speaking, if your PC is holding you back, there’s a good chance it is a candidate for new computer parts. A laptop will have limited upgradability (usually RAM and storage), but with a desktop computer virtually any component can be replaced or upgraded. If there are multiple problems in an aging machine, then you might be better off replacing the computer with a new one. But when there are specific issues—for example, lack of storage, a malfunctioning optical drive, slow Wi-Fi, slow performance with multiple windows open, lack of 4K support—the right PC part can make a big difference. If you’re not certain about whether your PC would benefit from a new computer part, or you have questions about compatibility, check with the knowledgeable staff at Best Buy, or the expert agents at Geek Squad—the Canada computer parts experts.
