With a fully-featured home theatre (or "home theater" as our neighbours down south spell it ) in your home, your movies, TV shows, sports, and video games become almost larger than life and better than ever. Best Buy has everything you need to create the home theatre setup that'll get your friends and neighbours talking (and maybe shooting you some jealous looks). Read on to see how we can help make your dream come true. TVs TVs are the centrepiece of home theatre systems. The type and size of TV you should get will depend on a few different factors, including the size of the room, how far you're sitting from the screen, and what kinds of entertainment you prefer. If you've got a ton of space you can opt for a larger screen, which should fill your field of view nicely and really bring home the home cinema feel. For incredibly sharp, feels-like-you're-actually-there resolution and vibrant, realistic colours consider a 4K UHD TV with HDR technology such as Sony BRAVIA XR. If you want to explore a nearly unlimited variety of online entertainment and services, you should check out Best Buy's wide selection of Smart TVs. Projectors A flatscreen TV isn't the only way you can enjoy incredible visuals. If you want to go REALLY big consider a home theatre projector, which allows you to create enormous displays up to 120" or more. All you'll need to complete the movie theatre experience is a tub of buttery popcorn and an oversized drink. Audio System A big, beautiful screen is only part of the complete home theatre experience. To be truly immersed in your entertainment you need a surround sound system that completely blankets you in detailed, realistic audio. There are a variety of home audio systems available, depending on your preferences and needs. If you just want to enjoy sound quality that's better than what your TV's speakers can produce, check out a sound bar. For a fully immersive experience you'll need a multi-channel surround sound system, which requires a receiver and multiple speakers placed around the room. Audiophiles will probably want to opt for the premium, top-of-the-line audio produced by surround sound systems compatible with sound formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. TV Antennas When it comes to watching TV shows and live sports, cable TV isn't your only option. If you'd like to reduce your cable bill you can pick up a TV antenna and get free HD TV signals over-the-air. (Yes, that's right -- HD and free. BOOM.) Keep in mind that you'll get different channel selections and wireless signal quality depending on your location and the type of antenna you choose, but for "cord cutters" a TV antenna is a great resource for local content and live TV. Stands and Mounts Choosing the right TV is one thing, but putting it in exactly the right position is another. Use a TV stand to place the screen at the right height for comfortable viewing, and to add a dash of modern style to the room. If you'd prefer to have it hanging on the wall, a TV mount will help make that happen. Home Theatre Seating Once you've got all the electronics set up, there's one final, important element: seating! Best Buy carries a wide selection of comfy and stylish home theatre furniture that'll complete your home cinema dream. Whether you're setting up a private movie theatre to share with family or just for yourself, you'll find the perfect seating for your needs.
