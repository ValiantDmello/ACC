They use coffee pods that are ready to go and perfectly measured out for individual use. You can choose ready-made pods or a Nespresso reusable pod, and they provide the perfect cup of coffee or shot of espresso because they are only pierced once they are put into the machine and hot water pours over the grounds. These machines make for a much quicker start to the morning, or make your nightcap that much easier to relax with. Original Nespresso Machines The original Nespresso Machines include the Nespresso Inissia Coffee Machine and the Nespresso Inissia Espresso Machine. The Inissia models come at a very affordable price without sacrificing quality, and are perfectly sized for small countertops and spaces. Even smaller are the Nespresso Essenza Mini coffee makers and espresso machines, an even more compact and lightweight model that pours your coffee or espresso in just 30 seconds. On the higher end of original models are the Nespresso CitiZ&milk, the Nespresso Lattissima One, and the Breville Nespresso Creatista. These are all intuitive, high-performance machines that can create more than one type of coffee or espresso, and all come with milk frothers so you can easily make a perfect latte right at home or in the office. Vertuo Nespresso Machines Nespresso’s Vertuo is the latest Nespresso machine. It’s a Nespresso with frother and has both barcode recognition and capsule-specific extraction that create a smooth and delicious cup of espresso or coffee and a delectable crema. Most of the Nespresso Vertuo machines available come in a bundle with the Nespresso Aeroccino Milk Frother. Nespresso Aeroccino Milk Frothers You can get a milk frother Nespresso on its own. Nespresso’s Aeroccino milk frother offers one touch operation to give your espresso the perfect addition of frothed milk it deserves. Plus, the Aeroccino has an automatic system that allows you to customize your coffee via the settings, so you don’t have to worry about burning your milk or having it be hotter than you’d like. It’s quick too, preparing your milk in just a minute or less, and is easy to clean thanks to its sleek and simple design. Frequently Asked Questions – Nespresso Machines What are the types of Nespresso Machine? Nespresso has two unique coffee systems – the Nespresso Original and Nespresso Vertuo. The Nespresso Original line are single serve machines including the Nespresso Inissia, Nespresso Essenza Mini, and Nespresso Delonghi. They give you fast, delicious espresso in an instant. Nespresso Original also has milk and latte machines including the Nespresso Latissima and the Nespresso Creatista. They create the perfect latte or cappuccino with one-touch. The Nespresso Pixie is a single serve espresso machine with two buttons, a solid stainless-steel handle, and a compact, sleek style. The Nespresso Pixie will brew the best espresso or Lungo in an instant. A Nespresso Vertuo machine lets you customize your coffee with 26 delicious blends and five cup sizes. You can choose the Nespresso Vertuo Next or the Nespresso Vertuo Plus, and both Nespresso coffee machines offer speedy heat up, adjustable cup support, and one-touch coffee creation. How many times can you use a Nespresso Capsule? Some users of Nespresso machines will run a Nespresso capsule twice. While you can do that, you’ll want to be aware the strength, taste, and aroma of your coffee pod Nespresso won’t be as high quality as your first cup. Maintaining Nespresso machines There are a few steps to maintaining Nespresso coffee makers or Nespresso with frother. How to descale Nespresso coffee makers Nespresso descaling is simple. You’ll fill the water tank with 1 unit of Nespresso descaling liquid and add 0.81 of water. You can enter the descaling mode by holding the button for a minimum of 7 seconds. Once it starts blinking, you’ll have 45 seconds to enter descaling mode. Should you leave water in your Nespresso coffee maker? While you can leave water in your Nespresso for a few hours, you shouldn’t leave water in your Nespresso coffee machine overnight or for days at a time. Tap water has minerals and sediment that may damage your water tank if left for long periods. How to properly clean Nespresso coffee makers? There is a cleaning cycle on Nespresso coffee machines. To start the cleaning cycle you’ll need to make sure the capsule container is empty, then push the button 3 times within a 2 second period. How do I change the cup size on my Nespresso? Nespressopods give you the option to make many different types of coffee beverages, and you can change up your cup size too. To program a cup size, open the machine head, insert the Nespresso capsule and close the head. Closing the head locks the Nespresso machine. You’ll push the button and hold it until your cup is as full as you’d like it, and your water volume level will be stored for that capsule size. Become your very own barista with your choice of the wonderful selection of Nespresso devices available. Whether you like your coffee or espresso black or prefer a latte or cortado, you don’t have to head to a cafe to get your caffeine fix thanks to Nespresso.
