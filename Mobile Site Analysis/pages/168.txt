Hall trees are a sub-category of foyer and entryway furniture. Tall and narrow, the furniture serves as a tidy place to store items like jackets, hats, scarves, umbrellas, purses, shoes, and more for easy organization and grabbing and going when you need them. They usually include a combination of hooks, storage spaces, and shelves. Usually placed at or near the front door of the home, they come in a variety of styles and sizes, from larger units that can accommodate many items for bigger spaces and families, or small hall trees for single or double-occupancy homes. Some are stylish, in wood finishes and colours like grey, taupe, espresso, white oak, and barnwood, while others are more functional in their design, with an industrial-like look and metal finish. What are the benefits of a hall tree? A hall tree, otherwise known as a coat rack bench, allows you to neatly store essentials you need when heading out the door, keeping your hallway area clear and tidy. An entryway hall tree is often the first thing someone sees when they walk into your house. So, it’s an important piece of furniture that shouldn’t be overlooked, not just for helping reduce clutter, but also contributing to the overall décor of the home. They also help you keep track of items, so you know your purse is always in a dedicated storage area, for example, shoes neatly in a row at the bottom, and winter essentials like gloves and toques in one spot. Hall trees can be statement pieces, too, with shelves used to showcase pictures in frames, a vase with flowers, books, or other ornaments. What should you look for in a hall tree? Size is one of the most important factors: will it fit in the space you want to put it, and does it have enough space to accommodate all of your desired items? If you have a lot of jackets, for example, you might prefer one with more hooks versus more shelves. Conversely, if you’re trying to keep small items like gloves, hats, wallets, keys, and others organized, shelving and storage boxes will be key. If you want to put it in a corner, you’ll need to look for a corner unit that will fit. And since hall trees typically sit against the wall, ensure there are cut-outs at the back to accommodate baseboards. If it’s for a hallway, look for a nice modern, rustic, or contemporary design that will fit with the decor of your home. If you plan to place the hall tree in an area like a mud room, however, or if you have an apartment with very little space, a more functional-looking metal hall tree might make more sense. Look for other features as well like a built-in hall tree bench for sitting while you put on shoes, and pull-out drawers or storage boxes for smaller items versus open shelves.
