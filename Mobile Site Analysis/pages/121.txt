Inkjet vs. instant photo printers There are two primary classes of photo printers. The first are the inkjet printers. These are desktop printers that can be used for a variety of printing functions including documents. But their high resolution, multi-colour support, and flexible printing options also make inkjet printers a popular choice for printing photos. Instant photo printers are designed for one purpose: printing photos. They are usually portable and equipped with a battery so they can be used spontaneously, anywhere. Wireless connectivity is a must-have feature, since these are most commonly used with a smartphone. Image size is limited by the size of the portable printer, usually 2 x 3-inches. An instant photo printer may print small, but it offers long-lasting memories, with glossy photos and even stickers. Inkjet vs. ZINK printing technology Inkjet printers use moving print heads with nozzles that spray tiny droplets of liquid ink. Inkjet technology can produce photo-lab quality results because of extremely high resolution (for example 9600 x 2400 dpi), and the use of multiple ink colours that the printer can combine for photorealistic images. Inkjet printers can print on paper, but also on other media including labels and iron-on transfers. The ink is stored in cartridges, which are sold in refill packs. ZINK (short for Zero-INK) is the most common standard for an instant portable photo printer. And unlike an inkjet printer, there’s no worry about replacing ink cartridges. In fact, ZINK printers don’t use ink at all. Instead, the special photo paper has layers of dyes that are heat-activated. Simply load up the paper in the mini photo printer and you’re ready to go. Customize your photo with a special app Many instant photo printers get special features through the use of a mobile app. For example, a Canon photo printer (SELPHY) has an accompanying SELPHY mobile app that lets you customize the photo layout before printing from your smartphone. The app also offers many ways to enhance and customize those photos, including filters, templates and stickers. An app makes it easy to make your instant photos even more fun.
