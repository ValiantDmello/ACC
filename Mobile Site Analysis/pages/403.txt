That means high-end design and components in a familiar package. It starts with the vibrant 6.4-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED, maintaining the kind of clarity that you often see in Samsung’s own screens. HDR10+ also makes content look good, while the 120Hz refresh rate navigates more smoothly. With barely any bezels, the phone feels closer in size to the Galaxy S21+, so it may be middle of the road. Not too big, not too small. With the Snapdragon 888 processor and 6GB of RAM inside, the Galaxy S21 FE has enough to function with the kind of consistency you would expect in a Samsung phone. Solid build materials should add to the feeling that you’re holding a quality device. You get either 128GB or 256GB storage options to save your apps and content, and expand it further up to 1TB through the microSD card slot. What the camera can do The Galaxy S21 FE comes with a triple camera array in the rear that includes a 12-megapixel main lens, followed by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide and 8-megapixel telephoto. Plus, you get a 32-megapixel front camera for photo and video selfies. Samsung keeps much of its camera software intact from the other Galaxy S21 phones, including the modes and features that stand out above others. You can use the rear cameras for Dual Recording to capture video with multiple lenses at once, along with Single Take and Object Eraser to make a little magic when shooting video or still photos of things that interest you. These cameras are closely aligned with the image sensors and lenses equipped in the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21+, so you can expect the same quality whenever you capture images with this phone. Reliable battery life The Galaxy S21 FE has a 4500mAh battery inside, and that’s the same size as the Galaxy S20 FE. That should be good enough to get through a full day, including when you have the Adaptive mode on for the 120Hz refresh rate. When it’s time to recharge, Samsung did boost the charging speed for the Galaxy S21 FE by ramping it up to 25W. Plug in for 30 minutes and it should get you up to 50% charged, with rapid charging ready to go every time you use a 25W charger. Samsung doesn’t include one in the box, but if you have one handy, the Galaxy S21 FE can handle a higher throughput.
