JBL’s vast line of portable Bluetooth speakers means there’s a choice for every listening need. Whether you want something compact and ultra-portable for a small space, a rugged and durable Bluetooth speaker for taking on your adventures, or something larger and more stylish for a more permanent spot in your home, JBL speakers are the obvious choice. Portable and powerful JBL Bluetooth speakers are known for their high-quality stereo sound and convenient features. Many JBL speakers offer the ability to be used as a power bank to charge your other devices, speakerphone function, and they’re often highly water resistant, with long battery life. JBL Headphones There’s a JBL headphone for every size, style and budget. No matter if your preference is for on-ear, over-ear or in-ear headphones, JBL makes a pair you can fall in love with. Featuring durable and comfortable construction, JBL headphones are your powerful music allies. Truly Wireless headphones These days it’s all about the wireless. JBL’s lineup of headphones includes high quality, long-life, truly wireless headphone technology that won't tie you down, with not a cord in sight. Noise Cancelling & Bionic Hearing headphones When you need to focus or just want to enjoy your music, podcasts or shows, without distractions, noise cancelling is the feature you need in headphones. Many JBL headphone models offer digital noise cancellation for the ultimate weapon in battling back against outside noise and sound bleed. Plus, JBL has also developed a Bionic Hearing feature that lets you get lost in the music while still staying aware of your surroundings—perfect for commuting or keeping an ear on the kids. JBL Home Theatre sound bars As leaders in the home audio industry, JBL also has exactly what you need for your home theatre or TV set up. JBL’s sound bar options include compact solutions with great quality audio, or more multi-layered home theatre configurations too. JBL sound systems are cord-free so you can achieve the perfect set up in any room. Plus, you can wirelessly steam music via Bluetooth and use JBL SoundShift to switch between sound from your TV and sound from your other devices. Wireless Multiroom speakers Some wireless multiroom sound systems can be so complicated, and pricey. JBL’s line of in-home multiroom audio speakers will easily pair with other speakers that feature the Google Chromecast built-in to allow you to stream your tunes throughout your house, to multiple speakers at once. Boasting voice control, you can easily use a JBL speaker as a smart digital assistant by just asking Google. No matter what kind of home audio needs you have, from personal listening, to shaking the house, JBL has a wealth of choice that sounds amazing.
