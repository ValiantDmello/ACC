Epson Stylus and Expression photo printers are renowned for their high resolution and colour accuracy. Small businesses, home office owners and families love the Epson WorkForce series of all-in one printers. These offer fast printing in brilliant colour and with razor-sharp text thanks to Epson’s PrecisionCore print technology (that outperforms laser printers) and DURABrite Ultra ink cartridges. They feature high capacity auto-feed paper trays with support for multiple paper and media sizes, easy setup and use, the ability to scan, fax and copy, and convenient wireless connectivity—all in a space saving design. For those who hate buying and installing replacement ink cartridges, Epson EcoTank printers have reinvented the inkjet printer ownership experience. With super-sized ink tanks, an EcoTank printer provides up to two years of printing without needing a refill and saves you up to 90 percent compared to buying traditional cartridges. Epson also offers a wide range of specialty printers including label printers, receipt printers, impact printers, and the Discproducer CD/DVD/Blu-ray customizer. Epson Scanners Professionals prefer a standalone scanner to the scanning capability of an all-in-one printer, and Epson is their brand of choice. Epson Perfection scanners offer the highest possible optical resolution for razor-sharp results. The Epson Perfection V800 photo scanner employs a dual-lens system to produce a whopping 6400 dpi optical scan resolution for commercial-grade output when scanning negatives, photos and prints. Epson scanners incorporate the latest imaging technology, with options including Digital ICE (automated removal of scratches, dust and other surface defects from the image source), Easy Photo Fix (automated restoration of faded photos), scan-to-cloud capability, and covers that are hinged to accommodate scanning bulky objects. Epson Speciality Paper For Printers It’s only fitting that a company with such expertise in printers would also be a leader when it comes to the paper those printers use. Epson offers premium matte and high gloss finish photo paper in various sizes, for digital prints that rival the quality you’d see from a photo lab. The results dry quickly, they’re fade-resistant and colours are breathtaking. Epson also makes professional grade paper that produces archival fine art prints with museum-grade quality. When you use Epson paper, you ensure your printer’s output is the absolute best it can be. Epson Projectors While you might know Epson best for its printers and scanners, the company is also on the leading edge of projection technology. Epson data projectors are popular in business settings, where they are an invaluable tool for presentations. Epson is also a big part of the home theatre revolution. Its PowerLite lineup of home theatre LCD projectors are the ultimate way to get the big screen experience in your family room. Why be limited by a 65-inch flatscreen TV that permanently takes up valuable space when an Epson home theatre projector lets you enjoy 4K, HDR video on a massive 300-inch screen that can be retracted when not in use? Whether printing in your home office or watching a blockbuster movie in your rec room, Epson products lead the way with cutting edge imaging technology.
