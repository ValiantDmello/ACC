From movie night to party time to your morning commute, the right sound system, music player, or set of headphones can turn the average and the ordinary into the epic and the extraordinary. Create the Ultimate Home Theatre System If you’re still relying on your TV’s factory-installed speakers for your home theatre audio, it’s time to explore the wonderful world of receivers, subwoofers, and surround sound speakers. Gone are the days when it cost a small fortune to set up an amazing surround sound system or augment your television’s built-in speakers. Now you can elevate the audio from your TV with the simple addition of a high-tech sound bar. Or you can start with a receiver and a few speakers, and build the speaker system of your dreams over time. If you’re looking for the ultimate experience, consider a home theatre in-a-box. These typically include a receiver, subwoofer, and several speakers – everything you need to turn your den or living room into your own personal cinema. Get Down with Bluetooth Speakers and Home Audio Systems Picture this: You’re zipping around the house, doing chores and getting things done, while your favourite Spotify playlist is filling every room. Impossible? Not with a wireless multi-room audio system. Just connect each speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi network and that’s it – you’re ready to move and groove. Your audio is synced in real-time across every speaker, creating a whole home audio system without the need to wire each component together. If you’re heading to the backyard, beach, or local park for some much-needed fresh air and time in the sun, grab a Bluetooth speaker. You can enjoy high-quality audio while you’re far from your home audio system, and your friends can play DJ by pairing their own phones to the speaker. Crank up the jams and get the outdoor party started, whether you’re lounging on the patio, sitting around the campfire, or soaking up rays at the lake. Take Your Music and Podcasts on the Go Thousands and thousands of songs in your pocket – what could be better? When you need to navigate rush hour, take the red eye, or push yourself to the next level at the gym, nothing beats an mp3 player in your hand. Pair your player with a set of noise-cancelling headphones or wireless earbuds and you can listen to the perfect playlist, or dive deep into an award-winning podcast series, no matter where your travels take you. Rediscover Your Record Collection Wax is back. And it’s no surprise why. Dropping a needle onto a spinning vinyl record isn’t just timeless, it also produces fully lossless audio. Translation: Music played on a record sounds as close as possible to what the artist intended. If you want to start your record collection from scratch, or raid your parent’s stash in their attic, you’ll need a turntable, amp, and some speakers to get started.
