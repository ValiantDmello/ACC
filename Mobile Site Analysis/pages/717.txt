Samsung has been a premium phone manufacturer over the last decade, and its lineup has included many flagship, mid-range and affordable handsets. The most notable are the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lines, both of which are updated with new models every year. These are the devices equipped with the latest features and technologies Samsung develops. Samsung’s mid-range handsets encompass some of the same design standards and features, though without all the trappings associated with premium models. The screens may be similar in size, but not the same resolution, for example. Cameras, battery life and build materials may also differ to accommodate a lower price point. The more affordable handsets apply the same principles in relation to mid-range devices. There may be similarities in size, for instance, but some features may not be included. There could be fewer camera lenses, yet stronger battery life because the components inside are less taxing. What features do Samsung phones offer? Samsung equips its devices with a wide range of features. They begin with excellent displays that are bright, vibrant and colourful, and may include ultrasonic fingerprint sensors lying underneath the screen. Advanced camera arrays in the rear may offer multiple lenses, and perhaps, even a DepthVision Time of Flight (ToF) sensor to take photography to new levels. There are helpful tools to snap better photos and video, like a mechanical aperture, improved low-light shooting and augmented reality features to enhance images in interesting ways. Fast charging and wireless charging are now common on many Samsung phones. Some even have the ability to reverse wireless charge other compatible devices through a feature called Wireless PowerShare. Premium Samsung devices have DeX, a unique feature that can display a desktop-like interface when connected to a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It also works with Windows PC and Apple Mac computers through the DeX app on select Samsung phones. Which Samsung phones are available unlocked? Most recent Samsung phones will be available unlocked, regardless of whether you purchased them outright or through your wireless provider. As of Dec. 1, 2017, carriers were mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to offer all devices unlocked. Older models predating that ruling may come locked to a specific carrier, but under the current rules, they can be unlocked free of charge. Any unlocked Samsung handset is eligible to work with any compatible provider. That also includes travelling abroad, where SIM cards from local carriers could work just as well.
