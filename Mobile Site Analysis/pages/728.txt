Apple's iPhone 13 is the most advanced iPhone yet. Available with a 6.1-inch screen, it offers greater brightness, better battery life, water-resistance, advanced 5G connectivity, and more upgrades. Best Buy offers the phone in both 128 and 256 GB capacities, which is double the entry-level capacity when compared to the iPhone 12. The phone comes in five stylish color options, blue, midnight, pink, starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED finish, with a durable Ceramic Shield front cover. You can buy the phone outright or opt for a monthly financing plan or tab with one of the major wireless carriers, including Bell, Fido, Freedom Mobile, Koodo, Rogers, Shaw, Telus, or Virgin Mobile. Find the right plan that works for you on the Apple iPhone 13 release date of September 24 (pre-orders available now). The key features of the Apple iPhone 13 The iPhone 13's 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen offers 28% greater brightness in the maximum outdoor setting than the previous iPhone and higher peak brightness for HDR content at 1,200 nits. The Ceramic Shield adds to the phone's durability, along with the IP68 water resistance so you can take it anywhere. The new iOS 15, which comes loaded with the phone, adds features like spatial audio and Portrait Mode for Facetime calls, Focus features to help reduce distractions by displaying only the notifications pertaining to what you're doing, Live Text that can recognize text in images, Apple Maps improvements like 3D views, new privacy controls, and more. With advanced 5G, Apple's new A15 Bionic chip allows for an all-day efficient battery, offering more than 2.5 times the battery life of the iPhone 12. You'll enjoy a speedy experience and a powerful device that can handle bandwidth-intensive tasks, multitasking, and more. What camera improvements can you expect in the iPhone 13? Featuring the biggest sensor ever on an iPhone, the iPhone 13 has a new wide camera and dual-camera system that gathers 47% more light, resulting in less noise and brighter pics with more detail. Sensor Shift OIS, first seen in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, helps stabilize the sensor to keep shots steady. New Cinematic mode for videos up to 40K/60fps can capture people, pets, and objects with depth effects and autofocus changes, and even allows you to adjust focus both before and after capturing the image. You can also adjust the level of bokeh in the Photos app as well as iMovie for iOS (iMovie for macOS and Final Cut Pro coming soon). With support for Dolby Vision HDR, you'll get stunning stills and videos in virtually any setting, making the iPhone 13 not only a compelling smartphone but also a sleek camera in your pocket.
