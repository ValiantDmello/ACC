It's the go-to choice for creative professionals because it delivers robust processing power, an edge-to-edge visual display, and breathtaking graphics, especially with the Retina 5K version. However, you don't need to be a graphic designer to use the iMac. It's loaded with Apple's innovative everyday desktop computing features that appeal to everyone. Let's answer some common questions about this popular all-in-one desktop. What are the advantages of an iMac over a traditional desktop? The conventional desktop setup is usually a monitor at eye level and an large CPU tower hidden away near your feet. The iMac's all-in-one design eliminates the bulky block of a CPU tower and streamlines everything right into one stunningly slim monitor. Apple's thoughtful design, with its round corners and 5mm thin display, is appealing to the eye and adds to your room's décor. It also saves you space and energy, using a mere 0.9 watts of electricity in sleep mode. Are there different types I can choose from? Which one do I need? The newest iMac comes in a 24-inch size, sporting a very different look that easily makes it the thinnest desktop computer Apple has ever made. It also comes in multiple colours for some extra personalization in whatever workspace you want to put it in. Apple’s own M1 chipset is designed to work more seamlessly with macOS and the rest of the internal components for a smoother experience. Previous iMacs came in two sizes: the 21.5-inch and the 27-inch, using the same IPS LCD panels with LED backlighting that the current iMac has. Which one you choose depends on how much visual real estate you require. Those working with visual design programs, video editing, or hardcore gaming are going to want to size up with the 27-inch to take full advantage of Apple's impressive beyond-HD resolution rates and graphics-focused architecture. The Retina 5K model exceeds expectations in terms of visual capabilities. The newest 24-inch iMac uses a 4.5K Retina display, whose body is considerably thinner at only 11.2mm. What features to consider when buying an iMac? Each iMac comes with a different level of processing power depending on the price point. The latest iMac is the first to feature the M1 processor, and aims to deliver major improvements in speed, performance and efficiency. Prior models featured fourth-generation Intel Core processors based on Haswell architecture. The i7 can clock speeds up to 3.4GHz and go even higher with the optional Turbo Boost 2.0. If employing intensive applications like Photoshop or Final Cut Pro, this kind of power will be indispensable. Want more info about Apple computers?
