The KitchenAid mixer you know and love first appeared in the 1920’s, and since that time the iconic kitchen brand has evolved to include everything from KitchenAid attachments to the KitchenAid food processor, KitchenAid fridge, and KitchenAid dishwasher. KitchenAid mixer A KitchenAid mixer isn’t just a stand mixer; it’s a statement piece for your countertop. Available in a variety of colours, sizes, and models, the KitchenAid stand mixer comes with attachments that let you whip, mix, and knead bread dough. With a choice of vibrant colours, there’s a KitchenAid stand mixer to perfectly complement every chef. KitchenAid attachments On its own, a KitchenAid mixer is a versatile appliance. When you pair it with KitchenAid attachments, you can do everything from chop to grind meat or proof bread. There are many popular KitchenAid mixer attachments, and you’ll find KitchenAid owners love the ice cream maker, the KitchenAid precise heat mixing bowl, and the KitchenAid citrus juicer attachment. KitchenAid food processor It’s not just KitchenAid mixers that get the full colour treatment. You’ll love the vibrant colour choices for the KitchenAid food processor, but you’ll love the way it chops, slices, and purees even more. You can choose from the KitchenAid mini food processor to the 7-cup full size KitchenAid food processor. No matter which you pick, you’ll enjoy easy chopping, pureeing, shredding, and slicing. KitchenAid major appliances KitchenAid small appliances give you the power to make and bake everything you can dream up, and you can take your dream kitchen one step further when you add KitchenAid major appliances. A KitchenAid fridge gives you the space and storage capacity for family meals or rows of beverages. With models that feature bottom freezer, French door, and counter depth, a KitchenAid fridge fits seamlessly in your kitchen. KitchenAid appliances can handle clean up too. A KitchenAid dishwasher blasts dirt and grime off of every dirty dish, pot, and pan in your kitchen. You can find KitchenAid dishwashers in stainless steel, black stainless steel, tall tubs, and some models even have a window and lighted interior. KitchenAid blender With a KitchenAid blender on your countertop, you can whip up an icy cold smoothie, crush ice, or use the pulse settings to liquefy, stir, mix, chop, or puree. Choose a colour to match your existing KitchenAid small appliances or mix it up a bit. Whichever you choose, you’ll never want to take this powerful blender off your counter. Stock your kitchen with KitchenAid appliances and everything you make or bake will be better.
