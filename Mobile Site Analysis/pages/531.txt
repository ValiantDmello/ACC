Available outright as of September 24 (pre-orders now) or you can get one from all major carriers with monthly financing or tabs, including Bell, Fido, Freedom Mobile, Koodo, Rogers, Shaw, Telus, and Virgin Mobile, the 5G-enabled iPhone 13 Pro Max has a sizable 6.7-inch screen, which makes it ideal for both work and play. With a durable and drop-resistant Ceramic Shield cover and IP68 water-resistant rating, the phone offers a new flat edge design with a surgical-grade stainless-steel band. The elegant finish is resistant to abrasion and corrosion, combined with a textured matte glass back. There's stainless-steel trim around each sapphire crystal camera lens and 20% smaller area for the TrueDepth camera, resulting in more viewing area for the display itself. What features does the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max have? The 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display not only offers more viewing area thanks to the redesigned camera, it also includes ProMotion, which provides a refresh rate up to 120Hz for stunning video, graphics, and motion whether you're gaming, surfing the web, or watching movies. The display combined with Apple's A15 Bionic chip allows for faster performance overall and smoother streaming. The ProRes advanced video codec, which is the same used in commercials and feature films, offers higher fidelity colour with less compression. iOS 15, meanwhile, adds features like spatial audio and Portrait Mode in FaceTime, Focus for showing only notifications pertaining to your current activity, Live Text for recognizing text in photos, 3D views in Apple Maps, and more. Keep connected all day with the longest battery life ever in an iPhone: the iPhone 13 Pro Max battery can last up to 2.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Bigger, better camera Enjoy a bigger, better camera in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, including ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto cameras that afford up to 2.2 times improved low-light performance. The new Cinematic Mode helps improve videos and allows for automatic focus changes – even after you have already captured a photo. With 4K/60fps videos, you can capture people, pets, and objects with unique and eye-catching depth effects. Cinematic Mode records content in Dolby Vision HDR for stunning results. Shooting in the dark? You can still get great results thanks to Night mode that helps improve colour, contrast, and lighting in challenging low-light situations. There are also Photographic Styles for an end result photo that suits your needs and preference. Enjoy popular photo features like Deep Fusion, Apple ProRAW, and Portrait mode with Portrait Lighting.
