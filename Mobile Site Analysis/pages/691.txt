This lineup has something for all levels of photography expertise, proving that a camera is something everybody can get behind. Fujifilm mirrorless cameras Fujifilm has a storied history going back to the emergence of film cameras, and in the current era of digital photography, it offers the tools to make shooting images exciting. Mirrorless cameras carry many of the benefits of DSLRs, only without the extra size and weight. Learn the ropes with full automatic modes, or take more control over how you capture the world around you by diving into the manual settings. Fujifilm’s mirrorless cameras are laden with features that can make any photographer comfortable. Larger CMOS image sensors help take in more light, improving low-light photo quality, or freezing fast action when shooting a burst. Face and eye detection ensure you never leave a person out of focus when keeping them in the frame. Film simulation modes bring back some of the nostalgia and artistry that characterized photos in bygone eras. Switch between them whenever the mood strikes to give your photos a different look that will make you look like a pro. Mirrorless cameras also don’t limit you to still photos because you can also shoot video in high-quality 4K or 1080p HD resolution. Fujifilm’s X-mount lenses are compatible with X-series mirrorless cameras, providing extra flexibility when you need a little more perspective to your images. Fujifilm Instax cameras Not all photos have to be digital where an Instax camera is concerned. These colourful cameras don’t just stand out for their unique design, they can capture a memory and make it permanent right on the spot. With a retro twist, photos develop and pop out on film for a dazzling finish to a great moment. Instax cameras are built with simplicity in mind, but not only for simple photos. With various modes to choose from, photos can turn out looking different each time. There’s plenty of room to experiment while rocking one of these cameras at any event or vacation. A built-in selfie mirror affords you the chance to turn the camera around and capture yourself or a group. Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Instant film is credit card-sized and easy to replace when you need to put in a new stack. No need to recharge when you have extra AA batteries handy, and no need to worry about losing the handle with the trusty wrist strap. Fujifilm point and shoot cameras Water, sand and dust won’t stop Fujifilm Finepix point and shoot cameras from snapping photos. These pocket-sized shooters are rugged by design, with waterproof, freezeproof and shockproof bodies that let them take a beating without missing a shot. You still get optical zoom and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to transfer photos over to an Instax Share Printer or mobile device. A wide range of modes and features keep these ruggedized Finepix cameras active and versatile for any adventure you set your sights on.
