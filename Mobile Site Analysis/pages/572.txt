When a Samsung phone is unlocked, it isn’t tied to a term contract or specific carrier. In the past, customers who purchased Samsung phones on contract would have them tied to their carrier’s own network and services. The reason why was because they would offer it at a subsidized price up front and make it up in monthly payments. New rules took effect starting from Dec. 1, 2017, when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) mandated that carriers were obligated to offer all devices unlocked. Previously, a locked Samsung handset could only work with a carrier’s SIM card. Those coming from other carriers, regardless if they were in Canada or abroad, wouldn’t have been compatible. Now, all Samsung models are available unlocked, though you still get the option to buy one on contract or outright. You can use it with any carrier you choose to subscribe with. You must own the device outright to do that within Canada, and since they support Samsung’s various phones, there are plenty of options to choose from. Does anything change in how an unlocked Samsung phone works? There is a significant difference between an unlocked and “rooted” phone as it relates to any Android smartphone, including those made by Samsung. These two terminologies do not mean the same thing. When rooting a Samsung phone, you are using unauthorized third-party tools to bypass media and app restrictions that would normally be in place. It can technically remove network locks, but it isn’t the same as simply unlocking from a carrier’s network. Rooting a Samsung phone may also void the device’s warranty, so beware the risks in doing it. An unlocked Samsung phone works like any other smartphone would when free to work with any carrier. This comes with real convenience while travelling, where you can use a local carrier’s SIM card, or take the phone with you in case you plan to live in a foreign country. Network compatibility may differ depending on where you go, however. Major carriers are usually fine, whereas regional ones could be more restrictive. Samsung handsets operating on major carrier networks in Canada can also benefit from roaming rates offered at fixed daily rates. The same is true within the country when you have a monthly plan offering nationwide calls, for example. What types of Samsung phones are available unlocked? There are no real limits on finding a Samsung phone that would be available unlocked. Samsung models have been sold outright, free of any network restrictions for some time. That includes past models like the Samsung Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A71, as well as the current lineup. If you do find a Samsung phone locked to a Canadian carrier, they must unlock it free of charge upon request.
