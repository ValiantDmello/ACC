Designed to provide the highest level of protection possible for your smartphone and other tech devices, OtterBox products are made to be especially hearty. While other brands of iPhone, Samsung, and assorted tech cases might focus on playful designs or super-sleek shells, OtterBox prioritizes protection. Their products are designed first and foremost to keep your fragile items safe, with a one year warranty and plenty of interior cushioning. But make no mistake: despite their tendency toward bulkier silhouettes, OtterBox still offers plenty of chic and sleek cases. Why use a smartphone or tablet case? A case is a great way to protect your smartphone, tablet, or other smart devices. It's natural for technology items to endure a few falls throughout their lifespans, and the likelihood of a fall or a drop increases for items that are used on a regular basis—items like smartphones, watches, or even earbuds. Keeping them in a case helps add a bit of personalization to each item while also providing protection in the case of falls, bumps, and scratches. Get the highest level of protection with OtterBox Perhaps the most iconic OtterBox design is their Defender series: a line of cases that offer extreme protection to handle, as the brand puts it, "any adventure." The Defender series boasts multi-layer construction and a textured finish, especially around the edges, so your phone is both easier to grip and better protected from drops. OtterBox Defender cases have port protection and exceed US military standards by up to 4x as many drops, and they feature drop, dust, scratch, and screen protection in one. If you need really heavy duty protection for your smart device, the Defender is hard to beat. Slim designs and sleek smartphone cases OtterBox also offers plenty of designs for those looking for sleeker, more stylish cases. The super-slim Symmetry series is a one-piece design that's easy to slip on and off of your phone, and its smooth exterior is perfect for sliding into a pocket or purse. It's an excellent option for a low-profile, lightweight case, but is still made with OtterBox's Drop+ Protection for impressive shock absorption. OtterBox cases for on the go For those who are always on the go, OtterBox offers the Commuter. A little slimmer than the Defender, Commuter series products come with Drop+ Protection, port protection, and an antimicrobial additive that's ideal for everyday commuters. No matter what your needs are, you can look to OtterBox for everything from rugged protection to purse-friendly folio cases. Choose a model that works for your lifestyle and have fun with your colour selections!
