What if there was a way for you to track a personal item so that you have some peace of mind in case it slips out of sight? Bluetooth item tracking devices are small gadgets you can attach to personal belongings and keep tabs on them using your smartphone or computer. They are small enough to attach to any number of items, and smart enough to track and locate them using the latest wireless technologies. Attach Them to Items You Don’t Want to Lose There are items you really don’t want to lose because of how valuable they may be. These can be keys, wallets, purses, phones or anything else important to you. Trackers are fairly slim, sometimes the size of quarters, other times a slim square about the dimensions of a matchbook. Slide one into your wallet or purse, link it up to a keychain, or even drop one in your car or laptop bag. Pair the tracker with your phone where it will then work with an app to help you find it should it go missing. When you misplace or can’t find your item, ping your tracker and it will ring out a tone within earshot to lead you to it. The total range can vary, but you are often limited to the best Bluetooth can do, which is currently between 100-300 feet. Some trackers are crowdsourced, like those from Tile. What that means is Tile users can help each other find missing or lost items. For example, if you misplaced your keys and another Tile user is within range, the app alerts you to the location. You can do the same for another user in reverse, where keeping the Tile app open on your phone can help someone locate a lost or missing item. Differences Between Bluetooth and GPS Trackers The latest Bluetooth trackers have a connection range of up to 300 feet, and maintain a signal indoors and outdoors. With their smaller sizes and limited range, they are often best suited for personal items that aren’t especially large. Wallets, handbags, purses, backpacks and keys come to mind. GPS trackers require line-of-sight to work, so are better suited to outdoor items or moving objects. Vehicles are a common one for these because they allow you to track in real-time without the need for crowdsourcing. Range is virtually unlimited, so long as a satellite can triangulate the location. Where Bluetooth trackers generally run on small batteries that need replacing, usually after one year, GPS trackers are larger and could operate on either batteries or a power source, like a 12-volt socket in a vehicle. Trackers and Smartphones It’s common that item trackers will work with both iOS and Android, covering a majority of smartphone owners. Smartphones are required to track and locate items this way because of the apps they work with. Manufacturers designed their trackers to work with mobile devices, and sometimes, computers as well. Those apps warn about lower batteries, with suggestions on when to replace them, negating the chance that you use a dead tracker. With a timely replacement, any item tracker will continue to do its job of improving the chances of finding something lost or misplaced.
