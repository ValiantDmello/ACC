Super thin bezels all around reduce the overall size of the phone to make it easier to hold and put in your pocket compared to the other Galaxy S22 devices. That screen doesn’t lose anything as far as how bright and vivid it is. It’s also still highly responsive with the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that makes navigation smoother at all times. The smaller size helps put the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor within reach, no matter how you hold the device. On the inside Samsung didn’t cut corners as far as performance goes. It is among the first to use the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, and comes with suitable storage and RAM. The one thing about a smaller phone is a smaller battery, and the Galaxy S22 won’t match the battery life per charge that the Galaxy S22+ and Galaxy S22 Ultra can muster. Cameras ready to go Despite its smaller size, the Galaxy S22 has the exact same camera array you will find in the Galaxy S22+. It has a new 50-megapixel image sensor, plus a 12-megapixel ultra-wide and 10-megapixel telephoto lens. The front camera has a 10-megapixel sensor. The similarities extend to the camera software, with all the same modes and output available. You should expect the same quality photos on the Galaxy S22 that you would get with the Galaxy S22+. That includes video recording, which has an Auto Framing feature that detects and tracks up to 10 people in the frame, adjusting focus whenever they appear. There are a lot of photography tools to work with when using this phone, not just with all the various modes, but also with settings. Its smaller size simplifies how to shoot in a variety of circumstances, and is even easier if you use it with a tripod or gimbal to get creative. Still running fast The Galaxy S22 does focus on speed when it counts. That isn’t just about the 5G connectivity that is now easier to access in larger urban areas with Canada’s largest telecom providers, but also about getting onto Wi-Fi and doing things quickly. The Galaxy S22 supports Wi-Fi 6 for the best wireless standards when you need it to stream without interruption. The newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset is the first manufactured with a 4nm process. What that means is the phone can not only capture better colours, more dynamic HDR and less noise, but also faster focusing and more interesting bokeh effects in portrait mode. The processing speed applies across the board to improve machine learning and general usability to give the Galaxy S22 an edge.
