Some differences do apply, one of which is the subtle shift in screen size down to a 6.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display. You don’t lose out on anything, though, as the resolution and clarity are still as good as they’ve ever been on a premium Samsung smartphone. The Adaptive refresh rate swings from 10Hz to 120Hz depending on what is happening onscreen, whether it’s static text or swiping and scrolling for smoother navigation. It also keeps the same level of brightness, including key features, like Eye Comfort Shield and Link to Windows, among others. The slick design blends glass from the front to the back with Gorilla Glass Victus protection on both sides. You won’t be able to use the S Pen on this phone because that’s exclusive to the Galaxy S22 Ultra, but if you don’t need to use the pen, this phone is just a step down. What does that ‘+’ get you? Unlike past years, there isn’t a big gap between the Galaxy S22+ and its smaller Galaxy S22 sibling. One of the key contrasts is with the screen size, where this one is larger in comparison to the 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display in the Galaxy S22. If you want the latest Wi-Fi standard, the Galaxy S22+ supports Wi-Fi 6E, while the smaller model is at Wi-Fi 6. There is also discrepancy with the battery, which is 4,500mAh on this phone, compared to a noticeably smaller 3,700mAh battery in the other model. When it comes time to charge the battery, the Galaxy S22+ can handle chargers up to 45W, whereas its smaller sibling maxes out at 25W. This phone doesn’t come with a wall charger, but if you have a faster one, you can take advantage of the higher throughput. Updated cameras The Galaxy S22+ shares the same camera layout with the Galaxy S22, so there won’t be any real difference in performance and output. It is an upgrade over the Galaxy S21+, thanks to a 50-megapixel wide lens, plus a 12-megapixel ultra-wide and 10-megapixel telephoto lens. On the front, you get a 10-megapixel camera. Some of Samsung’s software enhancements apply to the Galaxy S22+ as well. You should be able to get better shots in low-light and night conditions, and still have access to the various modes Samsung’s camera app provides. The newer telephoto lens has a 3x optical zoom and can also shoot up to 30x with a hybrid zoom. Things have also changed on the video side, courtesy of the new Auto Framing feature. It can detect and track up to 10 people, automatically adjusting how the camera focuses when they enter the frame or start talking. Samsung also added new technology to minimize vibrations to keep footage looking smooth and sharp, no matter what you’re capturing.
