The company is considered to be the second-largest appliance maker in the world, selling products under a variety of brand names in North America and worldwide. Electrolux has your home appliance needs covered with laundry appliances, including washing machines, dryers, and sets, dishwashers, stoves, including cooktops, wall ovens, and ranges, refrigerators and freezers. Electrolux Laundry Appliances Electrolux Canada has you covered in the laundry room with a wide selection of washing machines and dryers that can be purchased individually or in sets, and with pedestals if needed. Washing machines includes models ranging from 2.8 cubic feet in size up to 5.1 cubic feet, and in titanium, white, and stainless steel finishes. Models are high efficiency and front load, all of which include steam functions like PerfectSteam, which rises from the bottom to help remove tough dirt particles and caked-on stains. Other useful features you’ll commonly find in Electrolux washing machines include SmartBoost, which premixes the water and detergent to maximize cleaning efficiency, a sanitizing option that removes 99% of bacteria and 95% of allergens, reversible doors, and a 15-minute fast wash option in case you need something quickly. Meanwhile, the dryers come in matching finish options, and in sizes from 4- up to large-capacity 8-cubic-foot models. There are electric, electric steam, and gas steam options. Some dryer features that stand out from Electrolux include the machines’ ability to evaluate a load in 90 seconds to determine accurate drying time, a steam option to relax wrinkles and reduce static cling, and the LuxCare Dry System that gently tumbles garments using moisture sensors to determine when they are clean. In a rush? There’s also a 15-minute fast dry cycle with some models. Electrolux Refrigerators and Freezers A refrigerator is available to fit nicely into any kitchen, no matter the size, from 24” 11.8-cubic-foot models up to 36” French door refrigerators. Typically in stainless steel, some are all fridge while others have bottom freezers. Counter-depth, they can slide right into a dedicated spot in your kitchen. Appreciated features in many models include LED interior lighting, smooth-sliding drawers, a PureAdvantage Air Filter, water filter, self-closing doors, and convenient IQ-Touch electronic controls for temperature adjustment. Electrolux Dishwashers Keep your dishes in pristine condition with an Electrolux dishwasher, including built-in models in stainless steel ranging from 17.6” 5.8 cubic feet up to 24” models to fit various kitchen sizes. Also with IQ-Touch intuitive controls, they are whisper quiet down to 45dB for some models, so you can wash a load without disturbing others in the home. Different washing options allow you to efficiently wash different items, from extra-dirty pots and pans to stemware. There are also features like 30-minute fast wash and a sanitize option that can remove 99.9% of common household bacteria. With a leak detection system, Electrolux dishwashers include flexible spray jets that help deliver a targeted wash. Electrolux Ovens, Ranges, and Cooktops Cook dinner in style by choosing from a selection of Electrolux stoves, ranges, and cooktops, from a 22” smooth top electric stainless steel cooktop to a 30” slide-in self-clean induction range or gas convection range. Typically in silver stainless steel, some models come in bolder colour options like cobalt blue, including an electric double wall oven. Enjoy features like even heat distribution, a warming tray to keep food warm if someone is running late or while entertaining, intuitive IQ-Touch controls, and different cooking modes so you can ensure a perfect cook whether you’re serving up a turkey or an apple pie. For more than a century, Electrolux has been outfitting homes with a wide variety of laundry and kitchen appliances that help families and individuals get things done more quickly, efficiently, and effectively.
