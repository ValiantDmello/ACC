Streaming, gaming, smartphones, and smart devices are using more bandwidth than ever and they are located in every corner of your home. There’s no tolerance for dead-zones, or areas with subpar connectivity. NETGEAR’s Orbi routers deliver a best-in-class whole-home Wi-Fi experience. Place an elegantly designed Orbi router in one room, and a discrete satellite in another to blanket your entire home in fast, strong, and reliable Wi-Fi for every device. Orbi sets up in minutes, offers a seamless wireless network as you move from room to room, and automatic updates ensure your network is secure and always performing at its best. NETGEAR Gigabit Wi-Fi routers With a NETGEAR router, you can ensure everyone enjoys the best Wi-Fi experience possible. From the NETGEAR N300 to affordable AC1200 routers, the fast NETGEAR R7000 with AC 1900 speeds, to the tri-band Nighthawk AC3200, there’s a NETGEAR Wi-Fi router to fit any home, budget and need. Look for Nighthawk Wi-Fi 6 routers like the NETGEAR Nighthawk Wireless AX6000 for the fastest home Wi-Fi ever, and next generation wireless support for your increasingly connected smart home. NETGEAR Nighthawk gaming routers Gamers demand the ultimate in performance, especially when it comes to their internet connection. When a millisecond lag can mean the difference between eSports victory and defeat, you need the performance of a NETGEAR Nighthawk gaming router. Serious gamers connect their console or PC gaming rig to a NETGEAR Nighthawk gaming router for advantages like fast processors, high-powered external antennas, ultra-fast and low latency Wi-Fi with traffic prioritization, and Gigabit Ethernet ports. NETGEAR’s Nighthawk Pro gaming dashboard offers advanced features including geo-filtering to find the nearest server, device management, and network monitoring. Powerline, range extenders and wireless adapters NETGEAR also makes all the accessories you need to get great wireless performance in challenging conditions. NETGEAR range extenders can boost your existing router to blanket you home in dual-channel 802.11ac Wi-Fi. For homes where routers are overpowered by interference or physical obstacles like stone walls, NETGEAR Powerline adapters use the building’s electrical wiring to deliver Gigabit wired or wireless internet. When PCs or laptops lack current Wi-Fi support, a NETGEAR USB wireless adapter offers plug-in 802.11ac Wi-Fi capability. Network switches Although best known in the home for Wi-Fi routers, businesses and enterprise customers look to NETGEAR for leadership in network switches. Your home may not need a NETGEAR Insight managed smart switch, but the technology, security and expertise that goes into enterprise-grade products finds its way into every NETGEAR router.
