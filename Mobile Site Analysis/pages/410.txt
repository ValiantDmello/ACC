Whether you like having one to watch your favourite content, or as a tool to get a job done, a tablet serves a purpose. That’s why it’s important to keep it charged up when you need it. Apple’s iPad is one of the most popular tablets available, and each comes with a charger in the box. The charger may hold a different power level depending on the type of iPad, but they are the best way to keep the device’s battery full to enjoy using it on the go. What kind of charger is compatible with the iPad? There has been an evolution in iPad chargers over the years, starting with a 10W (watt) charger for the iPad 2, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3. When iPads were equipped with Retina displays, they moved on to the 12W charger. The iPad Pro models, both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch, use a higher 18W charger. Technically, you can use any of those chargers on any iPad, provided there is some compatibility. Use a higher power charger on an older iPad, and it can charge it faster. Use a lower power one on a new iPad, and it will charge slower. These devices have systems and redundancies to draw the proper amount of power, letting them charge faster without damaging any components inside, including the battery. It’s as simple as plugging the cable in on both ends, but complex electronics inside the device help regulate what the battery can handle. How are iPad chargers different from iPhone chargers? Apple uses higher power chargers for the iPad than those coming with the iPhone or Apple Watch, which have a lower wattage. The amperage is also different between them. For an iPad charger, the amperage is 2.1 amps, whereas for iPhones, it is lower at 1 amp. The iPad Pro chargers are unique from all of those because they use USB-C cables. These are the same types of cables Apple MacBook laptops use, and is a common cable for many other tablets, smartphones and gadgets.
