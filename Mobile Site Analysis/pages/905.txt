Apple’s MacBook Pro is the macOS laptop aimed at users who demand performance. With three screen sizes and three custom Apple processors to choose from (the M1 Pro, M1 Max, and M2), there is a MacBook Pro that’s ideal for any user and even the most demanding applications. Is MacBook Pro or MacBook Air better? As Apple’s flagship laptop line, the MacBook Pro beats the MacBook Air in virtually every aspect. The base MacBook Pro 13-inch is now equipped with the next-gen Apple M2 chip, featuring an 8-core CPU,10-core GPU, and support for up to 24GB of unified memory. The MacBook Air is available with either an M1 or M2 chip, with a 10-core GPU only available in high end M2 MacBook Air configurations. The MacBook Pro is also equipped with a cooling fan, so it can push the performance envelope further and for longer than the fanless MacBook Air. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro M2 also features 50% more memory bandwidth than the previous generation. Working with RAW images is 40% faster and conversion of video to ProRes format is nearly three times faster. It keeps its 13.3-inch Retina display, dual USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, backlit Magic keyboard, Force Touch trackpad, stereo speakers, FaceTime HD webcam, studio-quality mic array, the unique Touch Bar, and Touch ID button. Despite the power upgrade, the MacBook Pro M2 gets up to 20 hours of battery life. From there, the latest MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch models get even more powerful, with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, plus support for up to 64GB of unified memory. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro 2021 models offer other advantages over the MacBook Air, including Liquid Retina XDR displays with ProMotion 120Hz adaptive refresh, and 1600 Nits maximum brightness. They have more storage,1080p FaceTime cameras, six-speaker audio systems (with force-cancelling woofers), and studio-quality mic arrays. While the MacBook Air has just a pair of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports with MagSafe charging offered on the M2 model, these latest MacBook Pro models feature three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, MagSafe charging, an SDXC card slot, and an HDMI port. The MacBook Air is less expensive and comes out on top of the MacBook Pro in terms of weight at just 1.24 kg (2.7 pounds) for the M2 model. It is still possible to find the MacBook Pro 15-inch for sale. This discontinued model has a larger display than the MacBook Air and more ports, but it uses older Intel processors and can’t keep up with an M1 MacBook Air in terms of performance. Is MacBook Pro touchscreen? Apple does not support touchscreen functionality in macOS, and the MacBook Pro display does not support touch input. Which MacBook Pro is the best? The question of which MacBook Pro is best really comes down to your preferences and how you configure your laptop. The MacBook Pro 13-inch is a capable entry-level professional laptop that’s now even more powerful thanks to its next-gen M2 processor. However, if you need a bigger or higher quality display, the Liquid Retina XDR display found on the larger MacBook Pro 2021 models is a definite step up. The M1 Pro and M1 Max processors on these models are more powerful and both support more RAM (unified memory). The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops also offer more ports than the 13-inch model along with much larger storage capacities. Generally speaking, the MacBook Pro 13-inch is the base model in this lineup, and the MacBook Pro 16-inch is the largest. Either the 14-inch or 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pro with an M1 Max processor would be considered the most powerful. Is a MacBook Pro good for gaming? Apple designed the MacBook Pro laptops with content creation in mind, not gaming. There is no option to equip them with a discrete graphics card and they lack features like gaming-optimized keyboards. That being said, these are powerful laptops with next gen processors that have as many as 32 graphics cores to work with. In third party testing, the 2021 MacBook Pro laptops performed very well for non-gaming laptops, especially those equipped with the flagship M1 Max processor. Apple says the new 13-inch MacBook Pro M2 can play graphics-intensive games like Baldur’s Gate 3 nearly 40% faster than the previous M1 model. However, the MacBook Pro is not at the level of PC gaming laptops equipped with NVIDIA or AMD graphics cards. That means lower frame rates, and forgoing features like real-time ray tracing. In addition, games that will run natively on Apple silicon are limited. The bottom line is a MacBook Pro may be able to run your favourite games just fine, but it may not. The 2021 and 2022 MacBook Pro laptops are powerful, but not recommended for someone who is specifically looking for a gaming laptop.
