What is a clearance product? A clearance product is one that is marked down at special prices that offer a substantial discount. You’ll usually save much more on clearance products than you would with standard sale prices. At any given time, you’ll find hundreds of different clearance items on sale at Best Buy Canada, with offerings in every product category. However, you don’t need to be concerned that the low prices mean you are making some sort of compromise. They are not refurbished or damaged. On the contrary, clearance items are brand new. They come in their original packaging, with all of their original accessories. They are also fully covered by their original manufacturer’s warranty. In other words, by shopping a clearance sale you get a pristine, brand new product, at a fraction of its original price. Why are products put on clearance? Why would brand new products be offered at such dramatic discounts? The most common reason is that the manufacturer has a newer version of the product shipping soon and they want to clear older inventory to make room for the new. Because new versions are often minor upgrades or even cosmetic changes, shopping an electronic clearance sale is a great way to save big on things like computers, TVs, smartphones, appliances, and more. Occasionally, it’s an issue of the manufacturer misjudging the product’s popularity and shipping too many units. Or maybe there’s a colour that isn’t selling as well as others. It could even be an issue of seasonal demand—BBQs may end up on clearance in the winter, for example. For whatever reason, if a product isn’t selling at the expected volume, it may be added to a clearance sale. Either way, you win. Clearance items are brand new products that were selling at full price yesterday, but are now heavily discounted. What is the difference between clearance sale and final sale? There is a big difference between clearance sale items and final sale items. Occasionally, a product might be marked for final sale. This means the purchaser is buying it “as is” and can’t return it. Clearance items are not only brand new and covered by their original manufacturer’s warranty, but they are also subject to Best Buy Canada’s standard return and exchange policies. This means most clearance products sold by Best Buy Canada can be returned or exchanged within 30 days of in-store purchase or online delivery.
