The best thing about a wireless chargers is that you can leave your device with it and charge up while doing something else. Since the dock has its own power source from a wall outlet, you don’t have to look for a plug every time you want to charge your smartphone or a compatible wearable device. Charging docks come in different sizes and orientations, and most are for single devices, like smartphones. They can be pads that lay down flat, or stands that are upright. Others are larger units that allow you to charge more than one device at the same time. It could be an iPhone and Apple Watch at once, or a Samsung smartphone and Galaxy Watch. These charging docks use Qi (pronounced chee), the wireless charging standard that many devices currently support. That includes smartphones from top manufacturers, like Apple, Samsung, Google, LG and Huawei. It also includes wearable devices, like the Apple Watch and select Samsung Galaxy smartwatches. How does wireless charging work? Wireless charging is just as it sounds, where you are able to charge up a device’s battery without having to plug a cable into it. The technology is based on inductive charging, where an electrical current passes power along two coils to the surface through an electromagnetic field. When the magnetic plate on the device itself comes within range, the current is converted to charge the device’s battery. In order to enable this, there needs to be a receiver and transmitter involved. The charging dock or pad is the transmitter, while the device has the receiver to pull in the charge to the battery. Qi now offers different power specifications and wattages. The most common is 5W (watts), which is the minimum, which all compatible devices support. Some may also support higher wattages at 7.5W, 10W and 15W, though it may vary on the manufacturer and charger. The higher the wattage, the faster the charge. What are the advantages of wireless charging? The advantage of wireless charging is that it’s a convenient way to charge a compatible device without using a cable. Instead of using or buying an individual charger for every device you own, you can charge the compatible ones wirelessly. Charging docks and pads are designed to be highly accessible. Plug in a dock or pad near a wall outlet in a convenient location and then put the device in place to see the battery icon pop up indicating a charge. When you’re ready to go somewhere or need your device, you simply pick it up without having to unplug anything. There is less chance of damage or malfunction with wireless chargers because you’re not repeatedly plugging and unplugging cables. Despite the convenience, Fast Charging from wired chargers supporting such a feature are still faster than wireless power docks and pads. If you need the fastest charging option available, wireless chargers are not there yet, but some wired chargers continue to pave the way. Wireless Charging Pads Wireless charging pads may have started almost as a novelty, but they’re quickly becoming the norm. Charging pads make it easy to juice up your phone and mobile accessories without dealing with different types of chargers or having to physically plug your device in. If you are thinking of investing in a charging pad, here are a few things you should know first. What Are Wireless Charging Pads? Charging pads, also known as inductive chargers or cordless charges, are different types of wireless power transfer devices. Of course, you need to have a cable connecting the charging pads to the wall, but a cable does not need to be connected to your phone. Smartphone manufacturers will use wireless charging to allow you to simply place your phone on the pad to start transferring energy. This is also known as Qi charging. Many of the largest smartphone manufacturers utilize Qi wireless charging in their phones, including Apple, Samsung, Sony, Huawei, LG, Motorola, and other Android phones. How Do Charging Pads Work? Charging pads use electromagnetic fields between copper coils. The magnetic field creates a current that can then be transferred to your phone without having to be plugged into a charger. With Qi or wireless charging, the bigger the coil or the number of coil rings there are inside the pad, the farther and faster the charge can travel because more energy can be transferred. Many wireless power devices are made to charge up more than one device too. These power docks can usually charge your phone, headphones and smart watch all at once, meaning you can simply drop your devices and accessories on the mat at night and scoop them up again in the morning. Are Charging Pads Available For All Phones? While this kind of technology has been around for a while, more phone manufacturers have started to incorporate wireless charging capabilities in their phones within the last couple of years. What if your phone doesn’t support wireless charging? In this case, you can sometimes get a special phone case (which often has a special plug in the bottom) to take advantage of charging pads. One of the great features of wireless charging mats is that you can use them for many devices, meaning you don’t need USB-C, USB and Micro-USB cords kicking around. Important to note that the wireless charging might not work with thicker cases. Is Wireless Charging Fast? While wireless charging does tend to be slower than charging the phone directly via a cable, (especially if your phone uses fast-charging technology) you are trading speed for convenience. Each wireless charger will have different charging speeds, with some capable of fully charging a phone within two hours. As the technology is developed, wireless charging pads will likely become more efficient and faster than ever before.
