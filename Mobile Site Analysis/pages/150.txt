The checklist of things your baby needs will constantly be changing as the child grows and develops. You’ll be amazed at how quickly your little one goes from needing a high chair to a booster seat, or from wearing diapers to using a potty. Whether you’re looking for a stroller for your newborn, baby gate for your toddler, or a booster seat for your school-age child, Best Buy offers tons of great products from brands you know and trust. Maternity and Baby Clothes Before baby arrives there are many things to take care of, not the least of which is your own changing wardrobe. Browse Best Buy's wide selection of maternity clothes so you can continue looking good while your baby bump grows. When it's time to find garments for your little one you'll be able to choose from a huge variety of styles and sizes on Best Buy. From sleepers to body suits to pajamas, you can easily find clothes that will keep your little one comfy and cozy. Nursing and Feeding Whether you're breastfeeding, bottle-feeding, or graduating your baby to solid food, the proper gear can help things go more smoothly. A nursing pillow makes it easier to hold your bundle of joy while breastfeeding, and a breast pump helps you stockpile milk. When it's time to move to solids, feeding sets and sippy cups help reduce messes. At the table a high chair is an essential piece of feeding gear for young babies. As they grow larger you can transition your child to a booster seat, which mounts on your regular kitchen chair. Some booster seats feature an adjustable design so they can grow as your kid does. Nursery With a wide selection of nursery furniture in a variety of designs, you can put together a nursery space that's both stylish and comfortable. Don't forget to include furniture pieces that provide storage for clothes, diapers, and all the other little things the baby needs. A baby monitor is handy for keeping an eye or ear on your little one while you tackle the endless list of chores or take a well-deserved break in front of the TV. Some smart video monitors can connect to the internet so you can see and hear your little angel on your phone, anytime and anywhere. Moving Around As your child gets older, you’ll eventually have to move on from baby baths and diaper bags to booster seats and baby gates. Your little one will love exploring your home as soon as they learn to crawl and walk, so close off dangerous areas like stairs and the kitchen with a baby gate. When your child is ready to stop wearing diapers and put on their big kid underpants, you'll want to pick up a potty to help them make the transition. Best Buy also carries a wide selection of bath products and toys so you can entertain your child while getting them squeaky clean. Safety and Convenience Car seats are important for safely taking your baby out and about. Look for features like super secure safety belts, foam padding to keep your child safe and comfortable, and a retractable canopy for shielding baby from bright sunlight. A stroller is another essential item for going out with your little one and many models even come as part of a travel system with a fitted car seat included. Memories and Keepsakes Baby's first years are filled with precious moments you'll want to remember forever. Cherish your little one's milestone memories with photo frames and albums, and create keepsakes you can share with family and friends for years to come. Want more info?
