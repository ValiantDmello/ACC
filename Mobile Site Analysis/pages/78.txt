The iPhone 14 Plus is larger than the iPhone 14, sporting a 6.7-inch XDR OLED display, making it the same size as the iPhone 14 Pro Max. This phone retains the notch from previous iPhones, and doesn’t have the Dynamic Island introduced in the 14 Pro and Pro Max models. What it does keep is the Ceramic Shield glass that is tougher and more resilient than previous iPhone screens. It also presents the same improved contrast and colour first seen when Apple moved its iPhone lineup to OLED panels. Like the other iPhone 14 models, this allows you to either use a physical SIM card or using eSIM as a way to connect with your wireless carrier. It also includes SOS Emergency via satellite to communicate with someone when you don’t have reception, especially when you find yourself in a remote location.* Crash Detection is another, notifying emergency response if you get into a vehicle collision and are unresponsive.** Camera updates The main camera has a new 12-megapixel image sensor with a wide f/1.5 aperture. Apple’s Photonic Engine goes to work behind the scenes to help you capture better low-light photos by taking several photos at different exposures to blend them together for the best possible image. The 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera also returns as the second lens in the rear camera array. Video gets even better with the new Action mode. It stabilizes footage even more when you or the subject moves, smoothing out any shake or jitters in the shot. Cinematic mode also gets an upgrade of its own with support for 4K at 24fps to make footage look like even more like a filmmaking project. On the front of the phone, there’s a new TrueDepth camera that will focus faster for better selfies and video calls. The focusing will work on any app using the camera, be it FaceTime or any other photography app. Power and protection The iPhone 14 Plus runs on Apple’s A15 Bionic processor, a chipset that first debuted in 2021 with the iPhone 13 phones. It powers the device through all the tasks and features available, including video and gaming. That also includes all the latest features that come in iOS 16. Battery life gets a boost because of the bigger size. It supports wireless charging and works with MagSafe accessories to charge up the phone using a variety of different accessories. There are cases, charging pads, and docks that will make that happen. It may be bigger, but this phone is as water-resistant as the other iPhone 14 models are. The Ceramic Shield is tough, but you can also add another layer of protection with a screen protector, which is easy to find.
