That makes it easier to wield when you want a phone with a large screen and slimmer body to get comfortable. As one of Apple’s latest iPhones it comes with a number of new exciting features and improvements. New features of the iPhone 14 Pro The iPhone 14 Pro has a new OLED display that is brighter and more vibrant than the previous generation, allowing you to see the screen even in bright sunlight. It also features an Always-On display, which is a first for an iPhone. That means that you can see the time, battery life, and other important information at a glance—even when the phone is in standby mode. The iPhone 14 Pro is also equipped with a new crash detection system to enhance safety. If it detects that you've been in a serious accident, it can automatically call emergency services to send help.* If you're in an area with no cellular coverage, the iPhone will use the satellite-based Emergency SOS system which allows you to connect with emergency services. The feature is similar to what is offered by some car companies, but it's the first time such a system is available on a smartphone. Similar to the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 Pro has the Dynamic Island feature: the pill-shaped cutout for the camera and sensors in the display can expand in size to integrate into the wider iOS interface and provide you with actionable and contextual information. For example, it lets you to see battery levels for Bluetooth earbuds and headphones, sports scores, music playback, rideshare ride status, and notifications for some of your favourite apps in a snap. The iPhone 14 Pro is available in four colours: Silver, Space Black, Gold, and Deep Purple. The Black and Deep Purple colours are brand new colour options for the Pro lineup of iPhone. The Silver and Gold colour options are similar to those available for the previous iPhone 13 Pro. Performance Upgrades Powered by Apple's new A16 Bionic chip, the iPhone 14 Pro offers significant performance improvements over the previous generation. The A16 is based on a 5nm process, which makes it one of the most efficient chips on the market. It features 6 CPU cores, 5 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. With a capacity of 3200mAh, the iPhone 14 Pro battery is also a step up from the iPhone 13 Pro. For example, the iPhone 14 Pro will allow you to enjoy 23 hours of video playback, compared to 22 hours with the iPhone 13 Pro and 20 hours with the iPhone 14. The iPhone 14 Pro also boasts a 48-megapixel image sensor that is 65% larger than the one in the iPhone 13 Pro, which will enable you to take better images in low-light conditions. The rear camera array also comes with a better 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera that can capture low-light images with up to a 3x improvement. Not to leave out the 12-megapixel telephoto camera, as it can also produce better low-light images with up to a 2x improvement. Video also gets a boost, thanks to the new Action mode that stabilizes footage so you can capture smooth footage without additional accessories. Cinematic mode also returns from the iPhone 13 Pro Max, with allows you to shoot in 4K at 24fps to give a truly cinematic look to your videos.
