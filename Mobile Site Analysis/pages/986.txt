Welcome to the wonderful world of wireless mice, where cord clutter is non-existent and desks are always neat and tidy. Where you can toss your wireless mouse in your laptop bag or backpack and set up office just about anywhere your travels take you. Wondering if it’s time to take the jump and add a wireless mouse to your workstation? Keep reading for a quick breakdown of everything you need to know when you’re looking for the best wireless mouse for your setup. Types of Wireless Mice When it comes to choosing a wireless mouse you have two main options, either a Bluetooth mouse or a cordless mouse with a USB receiver. The difference between the two types is how they connect to your PC or laptop. A Bluetooth mouse is only compatible with computers that have Bluetooth technology, and requires some very light setup. You need to “pair” the mouse with your computer so that they remember each other and connect to each other when they’re both turned on. A cordless mouse with a USB receiver uses RF (radiofrequency) technology to make the connection. The mouse features a built-in transmitter that sends input signals to a USB receiver that plugs into your PC or laptop. Typically these are plug and play right out of the box, but sometimes you’ll be prompted to install a driver. Advantages of a Wireless Mouse The main benefit to a wireless mouse is the most obvious one: There’s no big ugly cord snaking its way across your desk, cluttering up your workspace and accidentally pushing things around. This is particularly useful for designers and creatives who need desk space for things like notepads, reference material, and so on. Plus, if you opt for a Bluetooth mouse, it means you also aren’t using up any of your USB ports, which can be used for other peripherals and accessories instead. For those who like to work while they’re on the go (or even hop from spot to spot around the house, from your desk to the couch to the patio) a wireless mouse is a must. They’re easy to put in a backpack or laptop bag and they won’t clutter up your table at the coffee shop. You don’t have to physically unplug a wireless from your workstation when you’re about to jet – you just pick it up, put it in your pocket, and hit the road. Things to Consider When Buying a Wireless Mouse If you’re leaning towards choosing a cordless mouse with a USB receiver, consider the size and design of the receiver itself. Some are incredibly small and sit flush (or nearly flush) with your USB port. This is great for laptops and when you’re travelling, since a large receiver could snag and break if you forget to unplug it when you’re packing up to go. Another consideration is power. Some wireless mice use standard AA or AAA batteries, while others feature built-in rechargeable batteries. With a built-in battery, you save money over the long run, but when the battery needs to be recharged you have to physically plug the mouse in to your computer or AC adapter. Want more info?
