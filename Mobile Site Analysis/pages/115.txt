As the name suggests, a dash cam mounts on or around your vehicle’s dashboard, and records video as you drive. The footage that’s captured could prove to be invaluable if you are involved in a collision and need evidence to prove your innocence. Thinkware dashcams are the gold standard. They feature the highest quality optics including Sony STARVIS CMOS image sensors in many models. In addition, Thinkware goes beyond the basics. Many of Thinkware’s dash cams offer advanced features such as optional rear view cameras, driver assistance modes with collision warning, Wi-Fi connectivity, parking surveillance modes, thermal protection for use in temperature extremes, and up to 4K resolution. Thinkware also makes it easy to install your dashcam, whether plugging into your vehicle’s 12V outlet, or hardwiring it using an optional installation kit. Thinkware F70 The Thinkware F70 offers incredible value in an affordable dashcam. Its compact design lets you forget its even there, yet it’s packed with advanced features including 1080p colour video at 30 fps, a wide 140-degree view, anti-corruption protection for your data, and the ability to operate in extreme hot and cold temperatures. With an optional hard wiring kit, this Thinkware dash cam also supports parking surveillance mode to detect and capture impacts or motion around your vehicle when you’re not there. Thinkware F800 and Thinkware F800 PRO The Thinkware F800 may just be the most capable mainstream dashcam ever released. Its 1080p camera is powered by an advanced Sony STARVIS CMOS image sensor. It captures highly detailed, full colour video with wide dynamic range, and offers exceptional Night Vision Mode for clarity in low light conditions. The F800 uses is built-in GPS to track your speed, and this dash cam also incorporates advanced driving safety features including lane departure warning and forward collision warning. Connect using its integrated Wi-Fi to stream video on your smartphone. With the Thinkware F800 PRO, you can also use Thinkware Cloud to remotely monitor your vehicle. Plug in the optional rear camera for crystal clear footage of any rear collisions. While the Thinkware F800 is a compact solution, if you’d prefer an integrated screen for reviewing video (along with touch controls), then the Thinkware X700 has you covered with its 2.7-inch touchscreen display. Thinkware Q800 Pro 2K and U1000 4K Dash Cam The Thinkware Q800 Pro 2K and U1000 4K represent the cutting edge of dash cam technology. Both offer the expected premium Thinkware dash cam features, including integrated GPS with advanced driver warning (ADS) technology, thermal protection, built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, parking surveillance mode (when hardwired), anti-file corruption technology, and rear camera support. The Thinkware Q800 Pro 2K is powered by a 5.14MP Sony STARVIS image sensor that delivers crystal clear 2K resolution footage with a wide 140-degree viewing angle. The U1000 is the latest Thinkware 4K dash cam. It delivers stunning UHD resolution front footage with an ultra-wide wide 150-degree viewing area. It includes a 2K rear camera. Video is made even better with a CPL filter that eliminates glare. Its 5GHz Wi-Fi connection supports advanced Thinkware Cloud features such as geofencing and notifications. Choose a Thinkware dash cam for premium design, the best quality video footage from your car (even in frigid Canadian winters), and the most advanced features.
