However, that is the opposite of the reality. Cyber criminals are more sophisticated than ever and even more determined to hack your devices. Ransomware, malicious mobile apps, e-mail phishing, infected document files and browser-based malware have made it riskier than ever to not have solid antivirus protection. The global cost of malware attacks has quadrupled since 2015 and you don’t want to be part of that statistic. That’s the mission of Bitdefender, to provide the highest level of internet security for all of your home and business computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected devices. Bitdefender Total Security Bitdefender Total Security is the complete security solution for all of your devices. This mega-suite provides advanced threat detection to defend against malware and viruses, phishing, and it offers multi-level protection against ransomware. It keeps private photos, videos and files secure. It includes a dedicated web browser that ensures your online banking transactions are safe from any fraud attempts. A dedicated VPN provides fast, anonymous and secure web browsing—even when you’re connected to public Wi-Fi networks. It also offers parental controls to keep kids safe online. Bitdefender Total Security is easy to install, with a user-friendly interface, minimal impact on system performance and 24/7 security updates to stay ahead of the latest threats. And Bitdefender Total Security protects all your devices, including Windows and Mac computers, iPhones, Android smartphones, and tablets. Bitdefender Antivirus The Bitdefender Antivirus family—including Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac and Bitdefender Antivirus Plus (antivirus for Windows)—offers maximum protection for your computers. This powerful antivirus software automatically detects, intercepts and removes malware and other threats, protects against ransomware, blocks and removes adware, and even protects your backups. Despite the advanced security offered by Bitdefender Antivirus, the software has no impact on your computer’s speed and performance. Included with Bitdefender Antivirus are features that protect your privacy, including a VPN that encrypts all online traffic for secure and anonymous browsing, plus an anti-tracker extension that prevents websites from collecting your personal data. BOX Security Hub To secure all your smart home devices, rely on the Bitdefender box. This hardware solution provides internet security for all the connected devices you tend to forget about, including smart thermostats, cameras, lightbulbs, printers, door locks and TVs. Bitdefender Box keeps hackers out and blocks any attacks that could threaten the devices on your network. This powerful security hardware also protects computers and mobile devices on the network from phishing and fraud attempts, web-based malware, and other cybersecurity threats.
