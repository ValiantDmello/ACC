Computer cases are an important consideration for anyone who is building their own PC. The case is the enclosure that contains PC components, and protects them from exposure. Advantages and features of a desktop PC case Computer cases come in many different form factors and styles, each with its own advantages. In terms of features to watch for, the most important is to choose a PC case that’s suited to the computer you want to build. Most importantly, it must have sufficient space for the motherboard, components, storage bays, a power supply, and cooling. Make sure there are enough drive bays for your needs, and that it’s equipped with the ports you want (and where you want them). Cable management is important and can range from holes drilled for cables to more elaborate wire covers to keep things clean and organized. Some cases also offer a tool-free design. Instead of having to use a screwdriver, these are equipped with thumb screws or similar mechanisms for easy access to the inside of the case, and easy installation/removal of components like hard drives. What are the different types of PC case? PC cases come in a range of form factors. These correspond to the size of motherboard plus capacity for drive bays and components like graphics cards. Here are the most common Computer case form factors. ATX case Also known as a full tower case, the ATX case is the largest form factor. It’s usually 60 cm or taller, with space for an ATX motherboard, up to 10 drive bays and up to 11 PCI slots. Micro ATX cases Micro ATX cases are form factors that are smaller than a full tower, and built to accommodate a Micro ATX mother board (which is significantly smaller than an ATX motherboard). These can be mid tower cases, mini tower cases, and even horizontal desktop PCs or SFF (small form factor) cases. As Micro ATX cases get smaller in size, the number of PCI slots and drive bays decreases. ITX case and Mini ITX case These two are actually describing the same thing. Mini ITX mother boards are the smallest, measuring just 17 cm square, and they are sometimes referred to as just “ITX.” Because the motherboard is so small, a Mini ITX case can be very compact. These are often SFF cases, but they can also be mini or mid tower form factors when an ITX motherboard is used as part of a gaming PC build. What about gaming cases? Gaming PCs are very specialized computers, and that means there are specialized gaming PC cases made specifically for them. On the practical size, gaming PC cases tend to be physically large, offering plenty of room for airflow and cooling systems. They also have the space for the larger power supplies required by gaming PCs. They have the room to accommodate full-sized graphics cards, plenty of drive bays, and full array of ports. Many of these cases are visual standouts as well. Their design can include unique sculpting, a range of colours, see-through panels, and integrated RGB lighting effects.
