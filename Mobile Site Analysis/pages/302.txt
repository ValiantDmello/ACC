Are there a stack of books or packs of paper holding up your monitor? If so, it’s probably time to invest in a proper monitor stand. With a monitor riser or mount, you can create an ergonomic workspace that’s not only comfortable, but tidy-looking, too. Check out Best Buy’s range of monitor arms, mounts, and risers to elevate your monitor and workspace to another level. Benefits of Monitor Stands If you suffer from neck strain or eye fatigue when working at the computer, you might need to adjust your monitor. Some monitors are adjustable in height, but many aren’t. Add a monitor stand to your desktop setup to raise to an ergonomic height and give your neck a break. Generally, your monitor should sit about an arm’s length away from you, and the top of the monitor should fall around eye level. A monitor riser or monitor arm makes it a cinch to adjust your monitor to an ergonomic position. Types of Computer Monitor Stands Monitor stands range from basic, easy-to-use risers to versatile triple monitor arms. Here are the types of monitor stands to choose from. Monitor Riser A monitor riser is a simple, stand-alone unit that raises a monitor to a comfortable height. It doesn’t require installation and can simply be placed on a desk or table to support your monitor. Some monitor risers are adjustable in height, giving you the flexibility to sit or stand as you work. Monitor Arm A monitor arm is just what it sounds like – an arm that holds up a monitor. Also known as a monitor mount, a monitor arm works like a TV mount does. It screws onto the back of a monitor and attaches to a desk or wall. A full motion monitor mount can tilt, swivel, and move up and down -- giving you plenty of options to find the perfect position. And because it suspends your monitor off the desk, a monitor arm also saves space. Multiple-Monitor Stand If your computer setup includes more than one monitor, consider a monitor stand that can hold two, or even three, monitors. A dual monitor stand or dual monitor mount has two articulating arms that can independently support two monitors. A triple monitor stand can hold three monitors, making it ideal for gamers, designers, or anyone else who wants a seamless screen-to-screen experience. What to Consider When Buying a Monitor Stand Monitor stands aren’t one-size-fits-all. Here are a few things to consider when shopping for the right monitor mount for your needs. Monitor Compatibility Check that the monitor stand can support your monitor. For monitor risers, look at the riser’s weight capacity and size to determine whether your monitor will fit. For monitor arms and mounts, consider the weight capacity and mounting pattern. To ensure a proper fit, look for a mounting bolt pattern that matches that of your monitor. Adjustability When shopping for a monitor stand, think about what you want it to do. Are you looking for something that simply raises your monitor up? Or do you need something that swivels and tilts? Monitor arms generally offer more adjustability options than monitor risers, but require more effort to install. Setup and Portability Setup time and portability are other considerations when choosing a monitor stand. Monitor risers require little to no setup and are easy to move around – great if you often move desks or need a quick solution for elevating a monitor. Monitor mounts take more time to install, but may be more beneficial in the long run because of their flexibility. Improve Ergonomics with a Monitor Stand What does your computer setup look like?
