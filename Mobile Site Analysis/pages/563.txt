What types of computers does Best Buy have on sale? When you shop a Best Buy computer sale, you can count on having a huge selection to choose from. Best Buy carries all the top brands in the PC industry, including Acer, Apple, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, and MSI. You’ll also find specialized offerings from these manufacturers including Republic of Gamers, Nitro, Legion, and Alienware gaming computers. Best Buy carries every type and form factor of computers, and you’ll find them all at our computer sale. This includes desktop PCs, mini PCs, all-in-one PCs, Macs, gaming computers, Chromebooks, tablets, and a wide range of the latest laptops for sale. Save even more with open box computers! What type of computer is best for you? Why there are so many different types of computers? Because there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all PC. Consider factors like what you are using it for, where you’re using it, and how much space you have available when deciding which type of computer would be the best for you. There are other variables to consider as well. Do you prefer a premium look, the flash of LED lighting effects, or something that’s more businesslike? Are you a Windows fan, or is Apple’s macOS your preferred platform? Students often need easy portability, durability, affordability, long battery life, an integrated webcam, and a very secure computer. That makes a Chromebook a great choice. PC gamers need plenty of power, including high performance processors and graphics cards. They are best served by a gaming PC or gaming laptop (depending on whether or not they want portability). Want a desktop PC but short on desk space? An all-in-one PC is ideal for you, with the computer and monitor all packaged in a single, compact, and stylish device with a small footprint. When shopping laptop deals, there are options for everyone, including ultra-portables, extreme battery life models, MacBooks, flexible 2-in-1 laptops, gaming laptops, Chromebooks, business laptops, and general purpose laptops. Save on computer accessories as well When checking out the computers and laptops for sale, don’t forget about computer accessories. Best Buy has sale prices on all the extras you need to make the most of your computing experience including computer monitors, mice & keyboards, printers, external and portable drives, Wi-Fi routers, software, laptop cases, and furniture.
