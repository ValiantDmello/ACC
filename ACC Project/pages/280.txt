Refurbished products are previously owned products that have been repaired so they can be re-sold, typically at a lower price than what a brand new model would cost. The repairs are done by either the original manufacturer or by a qualified third party refurbisher. In either case, the product is refurbished to a fully functional state. Typically, when a product is refurbished by the original manufacturer, the product will be sold as “Certified refurbished”. All refurbished products sold on BestBuy.ca go through an inspection to ensure they are fully functional. Products are also properly repaired, thoroughly cleaned, and include all required accessories. Refurbished products may have cosmetic imperfection(s) (such as a minor scratch) on the body of the device, but it won’t be in a location that impacts functionality. Buying refurbished means getting a fully functional product you want, but at a significant savings compared to new. Check individual refurbished product descriptions for warranty coverage and return policy. What is the condition of refurbished products? Best Buy’s refurbished products, including refurbished electronics, are classified by three different conditions: Excellent: A few to almost no cosmetic signs of wear Good: Light signs of wear in both non-visible and highly-used areas Fair - Visible signs of wear in both non-visible and highly-used areas Regardless of the condition, every refurbished product is inspected to be fully functional. The biggest difference between the condition levels is the visible signs of wear on the product. .For example, if you buy a refurbished iPhone 12 in excellent condition and set it beside a brand new iPhone 12, you probably could not tell the difference between the two. Is it worth buying refurbished? Refurbished products are popular for a reason. You get the product you want at a lower price than if you were to buy the product brand new. Best Buy’s Marketplace partners offer a huge range of refurbished products, including vacuum cleaners, TVs, tablets, PCs, laptops, bikes, headphones, appliances, game consoles, and more. Instead of having to wait to save up money, you can buy what you want or need sooner, thanks to the huge cost savings. Many of these devices are in high demand and from top brands, including Apple. This is where you will find Canada’s best selection of quality refurbished iPhones, refurbished MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops, refurbished AirPods, and refurbished Apple Watch. Is refurbished better than new? For most customers, refurbished products are well worth choosing over new. They get current technology, a product that has been professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned, and they save a lot of money compared to buying new. That savings means you can buy sooner or use the money you save for something else. Choose a refurbished computer and you will have plenty of cash left over for accessories. Buy a refurbished TV instead of new and you may save enough to buy a game console to go with it.
