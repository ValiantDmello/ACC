Connect your wireless router to your cable or DSL modem and enjoy the freedom of online gaming, content streaming, web surfing, wireless printing and so much more. Single- and Dual-Band Routers Wireless routers support either single- or dual-band performance. A single-band router operates on the 2.4GHz band, but may interfere with other devices on this band, including microwaves and cordless phones. A dual-band router lets you choose between a 2.4GHz or 5GHz frequency, reducing the chance of interruption with other devices. Superior Performance with Wireless AC The speed of your wireless connection not only depends on your internet service provider, it also relies on your router. Wireless AC is the latest internet protocol that offers superior speeds to its predecessors, wireless N and wireless G. With a wireless AC router, you can experience faster speed, greater wireless coverage and smoother performance. Network Security For your security, wireless routers use encryption technology to make it difficult for hackers and snoopers to access your information. WEP was the first security protocol introduced in wireless routers, with the more recent WPA and WPA2 offering stronger data encryption and greater security. Most routers also let you set up a password for your network, preventing outsiders from accessing it. Want more info about wireless routers?
