The innovative technology built into Braun shavers has put the company at the forefront of the personal care market, but that’s not all the Braun company is known for. Since 1921, when Max Braun designed his first electronic devices, the Braun company has grown into a global leader that creates innovative small appliances including blenders, coffee makers, electric shavers, travel shavers, and epilators. People choose Braun products again and again because they’re durable, easy to use, and designed to offer the user the best possible experience. Whether you’re just hopping out of the shower or are whipping something up in the kitchen, Braun will be there to make sure every day starts off perfectly smooth. Braun shavers move in straight lines When you choose the Braun Series 9, Braun Series 7, Braun Series 5, or Braun Series 3, you get the closest shave with the least amount of skin irritation. While most rotary shavers shave your face using a circular pattern, all Braun shavers move in intuitive and efficient straight lines. Ultra-thin foil to protect your skin Braun shavers protect your skin by placing an ultra-thin foil between your face and the blades of the razor. The foil captures your hair at a perfect angle, but the blades never make direct contact with your skin. Braun Series shavers also have pressure sensitive blades. Along with a flexible head, these blades adapt to your skin and ensure a close, gentle shave. Braun shavers offer wet or dry options Whether you like to shave wet or dry, Braun shavers give you that choice. Braun Wet&Dry give you the option of shaving with water, foam, or gel. All Braun shavers, including Braun wet and dry shavers, are 100% waterproof up to 5 meters. Built-in trimmer for extra versatility To save you time while shaving, some models of Braun Series shavers offer a built-in trimmer that slides out for easy sideburn clipping. Braun Series 9 When you want the best of the best, the Braun Series 9 shaver will be your shaver. It shaves more hair in a single stroke than any other shaver. It also has Intelligent Sonic Technology to provide you with 10,000 vibrations and 40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute, cushioning your skin during every shave. The 10-D pivoting head provides more contact, and the Braun Series 9 has a Titanium coated middle trimmer. Braun Series 7 and Braun Series 5 Braun Series 7 uses smart shaving technology to give you a close, gentle shave. With 30,000 cross-cutting actions per minute, Intelligent Sonic Technology, and 8 directional flexible shaver head, you can achieve skin contact as close as 0.05mm without causing irritation. Braun Series 5 has AutoSense Technology to give you extra power in the spots you need it the most. Thanks to Braun MultiHeadLock, offering 5 adjustable angles and an 8 direction flex head, every shave is close and comfortable. Braun blenders You can whip cream, mix batter, or blend up a smoothie with a Braun blender. Choose a Braun countertop blender, Braun Immersion blender, or a Braun hand mixer and you’ll enjoy ergonomic, easy-to-clean small appliances that take on every type of food prep. Braun coffee makers Wake up to the scent of fresh brewed coffee with a Braun coffee maker. With features like FlavorCarafe to seal in your flavour by minimizing air exposure, PureFlavor to brew at just the right temperature, and 12-cup capacity, every morning will start right. Start your day with Braun and enjoy small appliances and personal care devices designed with comfort and quality in mind.
