Printer Ink Having a printer in your home or office space makes staying on top of all your affairs easily manageable. Whether you need to print out school work, documents, signs, or anything else, your printer always comes in handy. Inkjet printers produce highly vivid images by using nozzles to place drops of ink directly onto paper. These printers require ink refills with appropriate cartridges. Keep your inkjet printer ready to go at all times with printer ink available on Best Buy for a wide variety of brands and models. Find the perfect fit for your printer Best Buy has printer ink available for nearly all printers, including all Canon, Lexmark, Kodak, Brother, Epson, and HP printers. Make sure you’ve got the right cartridge for your printer by finding the exact fit. All you need to know is the brand and model number of your printer, which can usually be found directly on your printer. From there, you can choose between different types of ink. Choose from a variety of printer ink cartridges There’s more to printer ink cartridges than just the fit, it’s also about what’s inside the cartridge. You can find the right ink based on your needs. Pigment-based printer ink, which provides water resistance, long-lasting colour without fade, and fantastic image quality, is best for photos and professional use. You can also choose dye-based printer ink, which can go a much longer way and require fewer refills. Additionally, you can pick between tri-colour or individual colour cartridges. Individual ink cartridges only contain a single colour, which means you will require a few different cartridges to produce a mix of colors. Tri-colour cartridges produce virtually all colours by mixing the three colours contained within one single cartridge, typically cyan, magenta and yellow. Individual ink cartridges are best for when you need prints that majorly use one colour, so you can easily replace colours as needed. A single tri-colour cartridge is beneficial because you only ever need to replace the one cartridge to get all the colours you need. You can also switch between a black ink cartridge and tri-colour cartridges as you require. Get the best use out of your printer ink Inkjet printers provide some of the best quality prints available, but they can also require a little extra maintenance in order to continue functioning at their best. To avoid dry out, be sure not to remove the current ink cartridge until you have the refill ready to go. Changing the ink cartridge requires a little TLC. Be sure to remove all packaging, including the protective cover on the ink dispenser, before gently removing the old cartridge and placing in the new one. You can use your printer settings to extend the life of your ink cartridge by printing less important documents on “drafts” or just in black and white. Want more info?
