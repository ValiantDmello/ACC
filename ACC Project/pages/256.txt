There’s nothing wrong with using one of these for console gaming, but when you don’t need to sit at a desk and you don’t need arm support for a keyboard and mouse, many console gamers choose a rocker gaming chair instead. What are rocker gaming chairs? Rocker gaming chairs are single-piece chairs that sit on the floor, with no stand or wheels. They are easy to pick up and move around and offer a comfortable sitting position for someone who is gaming and looking up at a TV. How do rocker gaming chairs work? Rocker gaming chairs work using a tried-and-true design. The have a curved surface that contacts the floor, allowing the person sitting in the chair to rock comfortably. The high-backed seat lets you lean back. There is no requirement to rock but many people find the motion relaxing. In fact, these rocker chairs are also popular for watching TV, reading, and listening to music. Features and benefits of rocker gaming chairs There are many benefits to rocker gaming chairs. They provide a comfortable gaming seat that is compact and easy to move. Many fold for storage, saving even more space when not in use. They are easy to assemble (some require no assembly at all) and also tend to be less expensive than traditional gaming chairs. Despite their compact size and lack of arms, rocker gaming chairs are extremely comfortable. They provide ergonomic support, with ample cushioning. Built-in speakers Some gaming chairs go beyond the basics and feature built-in speakers, including versions with multiple speakers and even an integrated subwoofer. These typically connect to your game console (or media player) wirelessly using Bluetooth, but will need to be plugged into an electrical outlet for power. Different colours and materials You can find a rocker gaming chair that fits in perfectly with your room decor or colour preferences. While black is a staple, manufacturers offer other colour options, including multi-colour chairs. The upholstery material also varies, with faux leather (which is durable and easy to wipe) being the most popular.
