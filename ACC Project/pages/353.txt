With TCL, being comfortable comes with the value of every product, be it watching, listening or staying cool in the summer heat. Minimalist and neutral designs fit with the efficient and functional purposes of deploying a quality device on your terms. TCL Smart TVs A TCL Smart TV is about more than just a screen, it’s a user-friendly route to get to the content that matters. Every TCL model is a Smart TV with Roku built-in, offering one of the most renowned smart TV platforms in the world right out of the box. When you turn it on, you see the familiar Roku home screen and all the content that goes with it. TCL TVs are available in two different lines: the more entry-level 4-Series and more premium 6-Series. You can find screens as small as 43-inches or as big as 75-inches across the lineup. If an even smaller screen fits your budget, the 3-Series 32-inch 1080p HD Smart TV covers that base. Both the 4-Series and 6-Series models support 4K Ultra HD, which is four times the resolution of 1080p. You also get HDR (high dynamic range) for better contrast and highlights while watching any content offering it. Innovative technologies like Contrast Control Zone, IPQ Engine and HDR Pro Gamma improve image quality and colour to elevate your viewing experience. With built-in support for Wi-Fi and Ethernet, TCL TVs support both wireless and wired connections to ensure all the Smart TV features work. Stream from popular Roku channels, like Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, DAZN and NHL. Instead of a regular remote, it’s a Roku remote that comes included with all models, no matter the series. With certain models, you can even search for content by voice using the remote’s microphone button. Brushed metal frames with thin bezels and all the latest connectivity ports make TCL’s TV lineup easy to fit in any home. TCL sound bars Adding a TCL sound bar to a TV viewing experience makes audio come alive while watching your favourite programming. The Alto sound bar lineup offers 40W of power with either 2.1 or 2.0 channels to deliver clear, loud and lively audio. The Alto sound bars are designed to keep distortion away for the freedom to pump up the volume for the big game, favourite show or movie. Adjust the sound profile to fit the content you’re watching with dedicated modes. With various connectivity inputs included, hooking up a TCL sound bar to any TV is easy. Using Bluetooth, the sound bars can stream music from any compatible mobile device or computer. A 3.5mm Aux-In port also enables wired connections from any playback device equipped with a headphone jack. The minimalist design should blend in nicely to any home décor, and with a wall-mounting kit included, there is always the option to mount it or lay it flat in front of a TV. TCL air conditioners Central air conditioning isn’t always available to every dwelling, and that’s where TCL’s lineup of portable and window units can cool the air. With a simple setup and easy maintenance, there are electronic controls and self-evaporating components built-in to work efficiently. TCL window air conditioners are Energy Star rated to keep hydro costs lower when beating the heat. You can do the same with a TCL dehumidifier to maintain a higher level of comfort at home by keeping mold and mildew away. The Energy Star rated dehumidifiers are built to last with different sizes to accommodate any living space. Being in the comfort of home feels even easier with the right TCL product at your service.
