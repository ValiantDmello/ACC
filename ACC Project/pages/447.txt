Dry erase markers and whiteboard erasers are designed mainly for whiteboards with wipeable surfaces. But they can also be used on glass, mirrors, melamine, porcelain, and other smooth, non-porous surfaces. Unlike with a permanent marker, you can write or draw something, then erase and write over it, again and again. You'll often find whiteboards in classrooms and boardrooms. But they are also pretty common in homes, available in all sizes from small handheld ones to large wall-mounted ones. They are used for creative or communicative purposes, like playing fun games (and keeping score!), jotting down notes in the kitchen, brainstorming at a computer desk or student workstation, or doodling in a child's playroom. But as noted, you can use dry erase markers on other surfaces, too, like window glass to mark measurements or porcelain to label cups for a party. What types of dry erase markers and whiteboard erasers are available? Dry erase markers come in a variety of colours, from standard black, blue, red, and green, to others like purple, orange, brown, or even neon. They are sold individually or in small or large packs, sometimes bundled with accessories like a whiteboard eraser (similar to a chalkboard eraser), cleaning solution, or even the whiteboard itself. Those items are also sold separately. Dry erase markers come in various sizes as well, from thin, bullet, or fine tip dry erase markers for precise writing and detailed lines (ideal if you're sketching or measuring), to larger and thicker wedge-tip style markers for drawing or writing large-sized text for big group or on larger whiteboards. Some dry erase markers have magnets to mount them on a whiteboard (which usually have magnetic backings), or on surfaces like refrigerators and lockers. Some also have small erasers built right into the caps. What should you consider when looking at dry erase markers and whiteboard erasers? Make sure to get the right size and colours to suit your purpose. A kit with multiple colours or multiple markers is handy so you can choose based on activity and keep extras on hand. The markers should be non-toxic and low odour. Some markers are quick drying, which is useful if you plan to write and erase a lot, as well as for left-handed people whose palms drag against the surface as they write. Magnetized backings can come in handy, especially with smaller whiteboards you plan to mount a single marker on and place in the kitchen for grocery lists, for example, or in your office for quick brainstorming ideas. While a whiteboard eraser is useful, when it comes to whiteboard cleaning, you can also just use a microfibre cloth, or even a tissue. And while erasers aren't essential, to get a squeaky-clean surface and make things simple, consider a whiteboard eraser, cleaning solution, or a marker kit that comes with one or both.
