Beats On-Ear Headphones Beats by Dre offers a wide selection of on-ear headphones that are ideal for immersive audio, when you want to isolate some of the noise around you, such as on a busy street or bus while commuting. There’s also a Club collection for use by DJs and those who want to listen to bass-pumping tunes. The headphones feature comfort-cushioned earcups, employ adjustable fits, foldable bands, and sound isolating designs. These play loud so those who love music in genres like rock, hip hop, dance, and pop can totally lose themselves in their favourite tracks. And they offer long battery life, plus quick charge in some models through Fast Fuel. Both wired and wireless models are available in finishes like rose gold, black/red, gold, gloss black, club yellow, club red, club white, and more to suit your individual style, each with the signature Beats “b” on the earcups so you can wear them with pride. Beats In-Ear Headphones Beats is on top of the latest trends, including true wireless earbuds, which are completely wire-free and designed to stay comfortably in your ears thanks to adjustable and secure fit ear hooks. They can resist damage from sweat and water, offer long battery life, reduced call dropouts via the latest Bluetooth technology, and the Apple H1 chip for Siri voice control. Available in colours like ivory, black, and navy, they also feature Fast Fuel quick charging. Other Beats earphones include a sports line of sweat- and water-resistant buds that include RemoteTalk for taking calls. There are also in-ear sound isolating headphones, and headphones that come with Lightning connectors at the end of the wire, making them ideal companions to an iPhone or other iOS device. Beats Over-Ear Headphones Offering premium noise-cancelling through Pure ANC, Beats over-ear headphones can block out unwanted noise so you can focus on the listening experience, whether you’re a DJ at a club or party, or just want some quiet time to listen to tunes without distractions. Fully enveloping your ears, they feature the Apple W1 chip, long battery life, Fast Fuel quick charging, and comfort cushions that allow you to wear them comfortably for lengthy listening, gaming, or DJing sessions. They come in colour options like black and blue. Beats Portable Bluetooth Speakers Beats also offers portable Bluetooth speakers like the Pill+, which offers room-filling sound from a small package with long battery life for listening both at home and on-the-go. Connecting easily and wirelessly to your mobile devices, it also includes a built-in speakerphone for making and receiving calls. The stereo active two-way crossover system ensures a pleasurable listening experience, and the easy-to-use interface makes it an intuitive addition to your music device collection. Download the free app and you can connect two sources at the same time and switch between them, as well as connect a second speaker for a more immersive sound experience. They come in basic colours like black and more adventurous ones like red or turf green.
