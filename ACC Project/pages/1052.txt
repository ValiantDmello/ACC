In 1945, he launched the first system for preserving food at ultra-low temperatures, and Sub-Zero Freezer Company was formed. In 2000, the company expanded the concept of precise temperature control to cooking with the launch of the gorgeously designed stainless steel Wolf and Wolf Gourmet lines. Wolf Gourmet Toasters Wolf Gourmet toasters include 2- and 4-slice models, as well as extra-wide models to accommodate all kinds of bread, bagels, waffles, and more. Self-centering bread guides position the baked goods for even browning, and they have different settings, including keep warm that provides gentle heat for up to three minutes after toasting has finished. If you like lightly toasted but your spouse prefers extra dark, dual controls let you toast two slices at different temperatures at the same time. Breakthrough Bagel Technology provides perfectly toasted bagels, and a frozen setting lets you toast right from the freezer. There’s also a cancel button, slide-out crumb tray for easy cleaning, and dampened bread lifter so bread won’t get stuck or you can easily remove smaller items like English muffins. Wolf Gourmet toaster ovens include convection technology with a powerful fan and high-volume airflow vents to circulate heat for even cooking. You can toast, roast, bake, or even proof bread dough, broil at high or low temperatures, and bake cakes and other treats using this countertop oven. There are seven modes along with an integrated temperature probe. Wolf Gourmet Small Kitchen Appliances For your morning pick-me-up, Wolf’s 10-cup programmable drip coffee maker can brew coffee at five strengths and the LCD clock can be used to set a brew to commence every morning, or at the time you desire—it will even remember the last brew settings. Accu-Brew Mode uses the exact water temperature and brew time. The machine has a clean cycle and uses a removable water reservoir and cone filters. If you prefer smoothies, the 1.89L stand blender has four settings, including smoothie, puree, soup, and ice crush. It has a variable speed dial, pulse option, and an emulsion dosing cup; and comes with food-safe stainless steel blades and a 64 oz. BPA-free Tritan copolyester jar. For cooking, a 7-quart multicooker can slow cook, saute, sear, sous vide, or make rice. The removable stainless steel tri-ply vessel and glass lid are both dishwasher and oven-safe. Use a griddle with a thick cast aluminum cooking surface and non-stick coating, meanwhile, for pancakes, bacon, and eggs in the morning, or burgers and hot dogs at night. Wolf Gourmet Cooking Supplies Wolf Gourmet cookware, including skillets, Dutch ovens, saucier pans, saucepans, and saute pans, all with matching lids, use proprietary 7-ply bonded construction with riveted handles, and offer even heat distribution, fast heating, and good heat retention. The pots and pans have flared rims to reduce drips when pouring and bevelled walls. They are dishwasher-safe for easy clean-up, and can even be used in the oven, up to 260-degrees Celsius. For slicing, dicing, chopping, and paring, Wolf Gourmet knives are made of durable and strong high-carbon tempered stainless steel. A 7-piece knife block set includes a 10” serrated bread knife, 8” chef’s knife, 6.5” Santoku knife, and a 3” paring knife, along with 10” honing steel to keep everything sharpened, non-slip shears, and the angled hardwood block. All Pakkawood knife handles are moisture-resistant and employ a triple riveted design that makes them comfortable and easy to hold. You can also get the chef’s knife, one of the most versatile knives for the kitchen, on its own. From breakfast to lunch and dinner for the family, Wolf Gourmet offers a selection of useful appliances, like toasters and toaster ovens, blenders, griddles, and multicookers; as well as supplies like cookware and knives to help you perfect your favourite recipes.
