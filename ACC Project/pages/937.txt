Audio Technica’s focus on high-fidelity sound quality has seen its products used during the Grammy Awards, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, presidential debates, Super Bowl broadcasts, and several of the Summer and Winter Games. For home use, the brand is best known for its wide range of wired, and now wireless, headphones as well as its turntables. Audio Technica Wireless Headphones Audio Technica wireless headphones include in-ear earbuds, true wireless earbuds, and over-ear models. Many work with the Audio Technica Connect app which allows you to control them from your phone, and they have built-in mics and touch sensor controls for controlling calls, music playback, and volume. In-ear models, ideal for sports, fit comfortably and securely in your ear thanks to Freefit ear fins and/or different-sized ear tips (including Comply Foam with some models). Many are also waterproof, so you don’t have to worry about jogging in the rain or sweat—wipe them down or rinse them off when you get home. Boasting battery life that can last through a week’s worth of commuting or workout sessions, true wireless buds can even quick charge in 10 minutes to get 45 minutes of use and come with a charging case. Several variations of over-ear Bluetooth wireless headphones are available as well, with features like 45mm large-aperture drivers with rare earth magnets and copper clad aluminum wire voice coils to provide clear, deep, and accurate bass response. QuietPoint headphones incorporate digital hybrid noise cancellation and hear through so you can let in some ambient noise when desired; and they fold flat making them easy for travel. Sound-isolating over-ear headphones, meanwhile, use memory foam ear cushions that fully seal your ears to block out external noise. There are QuietPoint in-ear sound isolating headphones as well with wrap-around ear hooks for a secure fit. Audio Technica Wired Headphones For those who still prefer wired, Audio Technica offers over-ear sound isolating professional monitor headphones that provide accurate audio for everyday users who appreciate better sound as well as professionals who use them for long studio sessions. There are also Sound Reality over-ear headphones that feature Air Damping Technology and a triple vent system to help control airflow for superior audio clarity. Throw a pair of basic in-ear headphones in your bag, backpack, or briefcase as a back-up, too. A really neat feature with many Audio Technica wired headphones are detachable cables with a 4.4mm mini plug on one and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the other. Audio Technica Turntables For listening to music at home, Audio Technica turntables include belt drive, direct drive USB, and fully automatic belt drive models. Belt drive turntables can typically play 33 1/3 and 45 RPM records, and some even come with Bluetooth so you can wirelessly pair them with speakers, headphones, and other audio devices. They also include a detachable RCA output cable for a wired connection to a stereo system, and an Integral Dual Moving Magnet phono cartridge to provide Hi-Fi audio performance. Fully automatic belt drive turntables, meanwhile, start the platter as soon as the tonearm is lifted, and brakes when the needle is positioned on the mount Playing 35, 45, and 78 RPM records, a direct drive USB manual turntable has a USB output and lets you convert music to digital files using free Audacity software on your computer. Whether you’re listening to music in a dedicated room at home, commuting to work or school, traveling by plane or train, working out at the gym, or going for a walk or run, Audio Technica has your Hi-Fi music needs covered with its selection of great-sounding wireless and wired headphones and turntables.
