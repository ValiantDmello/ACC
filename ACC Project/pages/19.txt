A USB flash drive might be just what you're looking for. Check out these frequently asked questions about USB drives to help you make the right decision when purchasing a USB storage device. Why should you consider a USB flash drive? USB flash drives are all about convenience and portability. Whether you need to transfer important documents, share photos, or trade music, these pocket-size data storage devices make it easy to carry your digital world with you. Unlike other external storage devices, a USB stick doesn’t require external power, so you won't need to lug around cables and power adapters. What should you consider when buying a USB flash drive? Consider how much storage you'll need, as USB flash drives range in capacity from 2GB to 256GB. If you're looking to store small and large files without worrying about running out of room, look for a drive that's at least 32GB. Also, consider the read speed, how quickly your system can access files, and write speed, how quickly files can be transferred. The higher the read and write speeds, the faster the device can potentially operate. What features should you look for when buying a USB flash drive? For the fastest transfer speeds, look for a USB 3.0 compatible storage device. A USB 3.0 drive is backwards compatible, allowing it to work in USB 2.0 ports at top-end USB 2.0 speeds. If you're transporting sensitive information or documents look for a USB key with password protection or other security measures. An On-The-Go (OTG) USB flash drive can be a convenient way to expand your mobile device's storage, but ensure your smartphone or tablet is OTG-enabled or else you won't be able to use the OTG features.
