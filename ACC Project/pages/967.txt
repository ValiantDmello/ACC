Because an unlocked handset isn't tied to a particular service provider, it can be used with any service provider in the world that operates on a SIM card-based GSM network. Simply place an activated SIM card in the handset and you'll enjoy the same or similar service. Some premium features may not be available. SIM card sold separately. Speak with your current service provider for more details.
