Firing tiny drops of ink onto paper, it reproduces crisp text and vibrant images using ink cartridges and precision technology. If you're considering an inkjet printer for your home or office, check out these answers to some questions you may have. What types of inkjet printers are there? Inkjet printers are available in single-function and multifunction models. Single-function printers can print only, while multifunction printers can print, scan, photocopy, and sometimes fax. Most inkjet printers are all-in-ones, giving you the convenience of multiple machines in one, cost-effective unit. Why should I get an inkjet printer over a laser printer? Generally, inkjet printers offer more wallet-friendly options than their laser counterparts. Colour inkjet printers are available at a fraction of the cost of colour laser printers, and are the best choice for printing high-quality photos. They're ideal for lower-volume printing, making them a great fit for the home or small office. What should I consider when buying an inkjet printer? If you're seeking the best inkjet printer for your needs, here are a few things to consider. Print speed Speed is important if you're a frequent printer. To avoid an anxious wait as you print a 50-page report, opt for a machine with higher print speeds of at least 20 pages per minute. If you print the occasional photo or email, print speed may not be as important. Print resolution Resolution, measured in dots per inch (dpi), determines the quality of your prints. A print resolution of 600 x 600 dpi is sufficient for text, while a resolution of around 1600 x 1200 or higher is ideal for graphics or photos. Wireless connectivity options From a selfie on your smartphone to a movie ticket on your laptop, you can print various things from a myriad of devices. If you find yourself printing from more than just your desktop computer, WiFi and other connectivity options are key. WiFi allows you to print wirelessly from your computer and other devices, while AirPrint lets you print wirelessly from compatible Apple devices. Some printers even allow you to email your document directly to the printer. Wired connectivity options If you have an older computer that doesn't support WiFi, you'll want a printer with wired connectivity options. Look for USB or Ethernet connections for easy pairing with your computer. Two-sided printing Are you environmentally conscious? Do you want to save money on paper? If you've answered yes to these questions, you may want to consider double-sided printing. Look for a printer with automatic double-sided printing so you don't have to manually feed the paper back in to print on the other side. Ink Not surprisingly, inkjet printers require ink cartridges. The number of cartridges a printer needs varies by brand and model. Some require one black cartridge and one colour cartridge while others require one black cartridge and multiple colour cartridges. Inkjet photo printers may take a special type of ink cartridge. Keep these recurring ink costs in mind when choosing a printer. Want more info?
