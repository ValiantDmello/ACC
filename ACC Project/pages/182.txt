Printers come in various forms and sizes, from office-friendly laser printers to economical all-in-one inket printers that can print, scan, copy, and sometimes fax from one machine. Best Buy carries a wide selection of printers and scanners from brands like HP, Canon, Brother, Epson, Lexmark and Xerox, to meet your needs. Tips on finding the perfect printer 1. Figure out exactly what and how much you need to print. Are you an occasional casual at-home user printing out a book report or snapshots, or are you a busy daily user with a home office who relies on a high output? Answering this question will help you determine what kind of printer and what functions you require. Maybe you just need a photo printer or maybe you need a multifunction printer that can copy, print, scan, and more. 2. Determine the quality of the printing you need. If you’re going to be printing presentation-quality text, graphics and photos, you may want to invest in a higher-end model with higher resolutions. Inkjet vs laser: Laser printers are the shining stars among office users, while inkjets provide high quality colour printing at a reasonable cost. Laser printers are phenomenal for high-speed printing and can tackle large volumes while today’s inkjet printers are far more cutting-edge and make for the perfect home and office essential. Inkjets can offer richer colours, and great features at a lower cost per page. An inkjet printer sprays tiny drops of ink onto paper to produce vibrant images and crisp text. With the ability to seamlessly blend colours, inkjet printers are great for printing everything from text to banners to professional-quality photos. Features such as built-in WiFi, Apple AirPrint, and HP ePrint make it easy to wirelessly print from a range of devices, including laptops, iPads, iPhones, tablets, and more. Perfect for the home or office, a laser printer uses laser technology and toner cartridges to deliver high volumes of prints at speeds higher than inkjet printers. With monochrome and colour varieties, laser printers are ideal for printing both text and images. And with added features like wireless capability, laser printers can be easily connected to by multiple computers. 3. Choose the right size printer for your space. Are you in a small office or apartment and want to make sure your printer doesn’t take up too much valuable space? There are tons of compact and portable printers to choose from, as well as ones equipped with WiFi for keeping them out of sight until you need them. 4. Make the call on colour or black and white. If you’re only ever printing out basic documents, newsletters, and rarely needing colour print-outs, it may be more economical to opt for a black and white printer. You can always opt to have photos printed at a photo lab or other service. On the other hand, if you prefer to have the flexibility and versatility of getting beautiful colourful printing results at home, whether it’s for a presentation or a snapshot, a colour printer is the way to go. If you are tired of wasting money on ink that constantly dries up due to your low volume of printing, find and learn about alternatives to purchasing expensive cartridges with HP Instant Ink. Instant Ink is a ink recycling program that allows your printer to automatically request ink from HP when you're low and they deliver it straight to your door before you run out. To enroll in HP Instant Ink you need to have an HP eligible printer. Want more info?
