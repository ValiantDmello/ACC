Where case options were once limited for Google’s phones, all that has changed with literally hundreds to choose from, covering a variety of styles and design materials. The most recent models are the best represented, but you can still find a way to protect an older device, too. No matter what phone you have, how you protect it is up to you. You may want a heavy duty phone case to make sure that a drop or bump won’t even blemish the device inside. Or you could prefer something more stylish that has a standout colour or pattern. Style is actually a big part of the selection, where you can wrap the phone around a folio case for extra privacy, or keep things see-through to let the phone’s own colour be visible, among other creative choices. Which Google phones are cases made for? The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are well represented in the bevy of options available. Both phones offer water-resistance and are made with quality materials. They are the two current flagships from Google, but they aren’t the only ones getting protective treatment. The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, as well as the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL, also have a large number of cases made for them. Like their successors, some of the cases come from Google, including the Hard Shell fabric ones. Even the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have their fair share, and you will even be able to find something for the original Pixel and the Nexus phones that came before it. Well-known brands make cases for Google phones, like OtterBox and Spigen, ensuring quality matches the name. If you prefer, you can also go for something that isn’t as popular, yet still offers the style and protection you’re looking for. Wireless charging One of the great things about having a case on your phone is the ability to still charge it wirelessly. The wireless charge can penetrate through the thickness of most cases, so you won’t have to take your phone out every time you want to lay it down or prop it up. That means you can use them with Google’s Pixel Stand, or any other Qi-enabled wireless charging stand or pad. That goes for any Google phone that offers wireless charging as a feature. There may be exceptions for heavy duty cases that are too thick to enable the charge, but that could also change as wireless charging technology improves.
