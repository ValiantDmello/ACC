These snazzy mobile accessories are easy to install and remove, and they make holding clunky electronics so much easier. How Collapsible Mobile Grip & Stands Work The most popular form of cell phone grip right now is the PopSocket, a type of collapsible mobile grip and stand. PopSockets attach to your phone or phone case with a strong adhesive that can be carefully pulled off and re-applied, and they offer a collapsible way to hold and stand your phone. Collapsed, your phone will wobble slightly in a collapsible mobile grip when laid down. It'll still fit in most pockets but won't pick up a charge from a charging pad. Extended, these grips prop your phone up at an angle for easy viewing, and provide a little nook for you to rest your fingers in. As smartphone screens continue to increase in size, a PopSocket or similar cell phone grip helps users hold onto their phones with just a couple of fingers. They're especially helpful for those with small hands and come in a wide range of styles and prints. How Cell Phone Rings Work Cell phone rings are similar to expanding grips, but they're a little more sleek. Instead of being made from soft plastic, cell phone rings are typically metal. They collapse to a flatter profile when not in use and fit better in pockets. When extended, cell phone rings typically lock into position to act as a kickstand for your mobile device. In the hand, you put your finger through the ring for a secure hold (unlike a collapsible grip, which sits between two fingers). Mobile finger rings come in fewer finishes and designs, but have a significantly sleeker look, which may be beneficial in professional environments. Finger loops offer a similar on-the-hand grip style to cell phone rings, but lack the functionality of a stand. Stationary Cell Phone Grips and Stands Cell phone rings and collapsible stands are the most popular solutions for awkward smartphone holding, but there are plenty of other options available at Best Buy. Car holder and on-table cellphone stands are less universal yet offer different solutions for mobile use. Instead of making your phone easier to hold, they simply provide you with a place to put your phone when you don't want to be holding it at all. Look to car grips and other cell phone stands for multi-angle functionality, charging ports, and other handy features.
