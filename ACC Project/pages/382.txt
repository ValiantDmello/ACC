Google’s Pixel smartphones have been at the forefront of mobile innovation from the start, particularly on the software side of things. That’s evident with each successive Pixel phone, the latest of which are the Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6, and Pixel 6a. The new Google phones bring exciting features to the line, including Google’s Tensor processor for faster, smoother performance and an adaptive battery that lasts up to 24 hours (or more) for the 6a. They feature water-resistant designs and an ultrawide rear camera lens. The Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6 add a telephoto lens and LDAF sensor as well for capturing some of the best images of any phone available. The same standard applies to older, more affordable smartphones by Google, like the Pixel 5, 4, 4a, and 4a 5G. These mid-range Google cell phones present the same software experience through a stock version of Android without any distracting overlays. While they may not have the same internal specs as the new Pixel 6 line-up, they are still capable devices. The Pixel 6 phones aren’t the only ones to run on next-generation 5G networks: even some of the older models will see you through to the next stage in wireless connectivity. What Google Pixel phones can do Google Pixel phones have always come unlocked, letting you use them on any carrier networks in Canada, or international ones when travelling abroad. Starting with the Pixel 4, Google also added eSIM support, meaning you can connect to your carrier’s services without having to put in a physical card. Google’s Android experience on the Pixel comes with unique features. Use Call Screen to screen a caller before picking up to see if it’s a legitimate call or not. A feature called Hold for Me has Google Assistant take over when you’re waiting on hold and alert you when it’s time to talk. Extreme Battery Saver, meanwhile, stretches battery life so you aren’t left in the red at a critical time. Google guarantees three years of major Android and security updates for most Pixel devices, upping that to an impressive five years for the Pixel 6 line and newer devices. That will give you the latest OS versions for some time after you first get your hands on one. New features come with each major update, adding to the functionality of the phone along the way. Taking mobile photography to new heights Pixel phones have become trailblazers for mobile photography by making software do so much of the work to produce such great images. The user-friendly camera app has various shooting modes, and they get better year after year. With the Pixel 6, Google brings forward capabilities found in the Pixel 5, like integrating the excellent Night Sight low-light and night photography mode into the solid Portrait mode for capturing dramatic portraits in any low-light environment. Use the Portrait Light feature to change the lighting on a subject’s face without affecting the rest of the photo. Shoot high-quality video in 4K resolution at different framerates, including creative ways to capture a scene. Introduced in the Pixel 5, Cinematic Pan is a set mode that smooths panning and action just enough to make it look like you’re filming a movie. With Locked and Active, it’s easier to stay with a subject while filming them. Other cool photo features you’ll find in Pixel models like the new Pixel 6 line-up include Face Unblur for fixing out-of-focus faces, Magic Eraser for removing unwanted objects, and Real Tone for accurately and authentically capturing different skin tones. The Pixel’s camera features are simple to use, yet extensive in their output. There are few smartphones available that compete with Google phones in this arena. So, when you buy a Pixel phone, you know you’re getting top-notch quality. Up your mobile game with a Google Pixel smartphone What are the latest Google Pixel devices?
