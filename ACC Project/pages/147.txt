Seller Return PolicyRead return policy Customer Reviews About This Product HD710 PRO External Hard Drive Beyond IP68 for Exceptional Protection Designed for outdoor people who want rugged devices to record their adventures and then carry the date, the HD710 PRO provides better advantages than other external hard drives in a robust and stylish enclosure at an attractive price point. The HD710 Pro takes external hard drive durability further, which is not only equipped with beyond IP68 dust and waterproof standards, but also passes military-grade shock proofing with triple-layered protective construction, an especially important factor for those who are actively-minded. With up to 4TB capacity, HD710 Pro is your best companion in keeping content safe whether you go diving, hiking, biking, or simply take a quick stroll. Storing, transporting and sharing data on-the-go is made easy with HD710 PRO, which is available with up to 4TB capacity and in four vivid colors, Black, Yellow, Blue and Red. HD710 PRO is backed by 3-year limited warranty for worry-free ownership experience. Military-grade Toughness The HD710 PRO passed US Army MIL-STD-810G 516.6 standard, meaning it can easily take falls from 1.5 meters. Your data is safe, so feel free to go out there and take on more challenges. Durable Triple-layered Construction The HD710 PRO has three primary layers covering around, from tough silicone, through a shock absorbing buffer, and then the tough plastic shell which is the closest layer to the drive itself and holds it firmly in place. G Shock Vibration Sensing Technology The HD710 Pro features Shock sensors that immediately stop all drive activities if a shock is detected. Once vibrations fully end, activity will resume. You're kept fully informed with a clear status indicator. Neat Cable Management The HD710 PRO is equipped with a nifty groove that goes around its shell, serving as convenient storage for the detachable USB cable. When it's not in use, you just disconnect the cable, then easily wrap it around the HD710 PRO, and get going. This greatly reduces the risk of annoying cable misplacement and clutter. Pick Your Capacity and Color The HD710 PRO is available with up to 4TB capacity which enables you to get the flexibility of great external storage for your needs. You can also match your style with 4 vivid color options - Red / Yellow / Blue / Black that HD710 PRO provides. Ergonomic Waterproof Port Cover No more fiddling and pressing to find the right angle until the port cover is finally closed, the HD710 PRO has an easy to-use USB port cover which is one-touch easy but totally secure and waterproof. By having the cover fully closed, you can keep your data safe, while submerging the HD710 PRO into 2 meter deep in 60 minutes.
