All Rights Reserved. Where is 5G currently available? 5G is currently available with compatible devices in select areas of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Montréal, the Greater Toronto Area, and more. Coverage is approximate; actual coverage may vary and may not include indoor coverage; see bell.ca/5G. How will I know that I’m using 5G? The 5G network symbol appearing on a 5G device while in use means that 5G is available on the Bell network in the surrounding local area of the device. Is there anything that can affect 5G performance? Speed, performance and whether a 5G device uses the available 5G depend on various factors including topography, environmental conditions, the current serving radio conditions at your location, and whether the device is actively downloading or uploading data and subject to Bell’s Internet traffic management practices (e.g., priority access to emergency personnel and critical infrastructure personnel). See bell.ca/ITMP. Will my device still work if I’m located in an area that doesn’t have a 5G network? Outside 5G areas, 5G devices will continue to have access to our fastest 4G speeds available.
