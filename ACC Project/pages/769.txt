August also offers users a unique method of control over who can enter their homes, and when.

For instance, August allows you to provide keyless entry access for trusted individuals like friends, family members, employees, and delivery personnel. When you pair an August smart lock with your personal smart device via Bluetooth, it will detect your comings and goings and unlock the door for you when you arrive at home and lock it again when you leave. August locks are also quick and easy to install, they work with your existing deadbolt (so you still have the option of using your old-fashioned key), and they’re fully compatible with such smart home ecosystems as Works with Nest, meaning they’ll work within your broader smart home framework to provide even more functionality and convenience.
