Read more Free yourself with a new plan from Freedom Mobile What makes Freedom Mobile different? Freedom Mobile was birthed on the idea that the Canadian market needed an alternative choice for wireless service. That meant lower prices, flatter rates, affordable devices, and easy billing. Those features still remain the primary pillars that Freedom espouses, as it continues to strive to be a solid option throughout much of the country. As its network grows, the number of phones it supports has grown with it, covering a pretty wide range of devices. That includes affordable low-cost models, as well as the latest premium flagships. Because the company highlights “bring your own phone” and prepaid plans, you don’t necessarily have to buy your phone directly from Freedom. Where Freedom tries to deliver better deals is in the amount of data you are allocated, and what it will cost you per month. However, it also aims to be very competitive with long distance rates and roaming charges to make up for the more limited coverage compared to the Big 3 incumbents. There are Family Plans to pool resources and get a better deal that way as well. Freedom often offers seasonal deals, like Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Boxing Day, by lowering prices or setting up limited-time plans with better value. What kind of coverage does Freedom Mobile have in Canada? Freedom’s network has two components to it that are important to note based on where you live. Its own website shows current coverage areas broken down into specific segments. Its 4G LTE network is most prominent in major population centres in B.C., Alberta and Ontario, though its coverage may also extend to outlying areas and other provinces as well. In areas outside of its primary service, Freedom Mobile SIM cards will connect to partner networks, which may be one of the Big 3 wireless networks. When it can go either way, that’s called “variable” coverage, noted by the phone itself when it displays either “Freedom” or “Nationwide” to confirm what it is connecting to. Anything outside of the Freedom coverage zones is considered Nationwide, and may be subject to additional pay-per-use costs, unless part of it is covered in your monthly plan. Freedom WiFi networks are also free to join to help stay connected. There are 450,000 set up in Western Canada, and that includes open access in Toronto’s TTC Subway and Vancouver’s SkyTrain public transit systems. What phones does Freedom Mobile support? A wide assortment of smartphones will work on Freedom’s network. Any phone using a GSM SIM card and supporting the appropriate frequency bands will be compatible. That covers the latest iPhone and Android models, with a big cross-section of types and sizes. That includes iPhones ranging from the budget-friendly iPhone SE to the premium iPhone 12 Pro Max. Samsung devices, like the more affordable Galaxy A series are just as compatible as the high-end Galaxy S or Note series. Even specialized or unique models, like flip smartphones and low-cost feature phones are among them. Freedom’s coverage also extends to tablets and wearables, like the iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab, and Apple Watch. When you also want to stay connected with those devices, there are SIMs that can work with them, too. Free yourself with a new plan from Freedom Mobile What makes Freedom Mobile different?
