While the company was initially known for household appliances, namely its innovative vacuum technology, Dyson has since expanded into other categories, like hair care. But at the heart of every product Dyson makes, which range from vacuums to air purifiers, heaters, fans, and hair dryers, is intense research and testing in the lab with the company's more than 2,000 engineers and experts to ensure that the products solve common pain points. That might be finding effective suction power for a vacuum, sufficiently cleaning the air of airborne particles, or simplifying the process of straightening hair without damaging it. Dyson, in fact, was the first company to create a transparent dust bin for its vacuums, which has become a popular feature that has inspired many products since. Dyson vacuums Dyson makes four main types of vacuums: cordless stick vacuums, handheld vacuums, upright vacuums, and canister vacuums so there's a model to suit every type of use case and household. Over the years, the popular cordless vacuums have improved in technology to offer better suction and longer battery life, like the Dyson V10 that can run for up to an hour per charge. There's even laser technology in one model that lets you physically see the tiniest of dust particles as you pick them up. For larger home or room needs, Dyson upright vacuums like the Animal 2 line offer powerful suction for carpeting, floors, tiles, and more. They maneuver easily and smoothly around corners and obstacles, ensuring a full and effortless clean. Technology like Dyson's Root Cyclone and Ball can dig deep into carpets, picking up even the toughest and most embedded debris, whether it's pet hair, food crumbs, or dirt build-up. Finally, Dyson canister vacuums dutifully follow you around as you clean, storing dirt and debris in the ball-shaped canister while you enjoy the comfort and seamlessness of the attached stick vacuum for navigating hard-to-reach spaces. If the ball topples over, it self-rights itself so you never have to worry about dragging the unit along as you clean. All Dyson vacuums come with or work with a variety of attachments and tools so you can clean everything from your kitchen floor to your car, mattress, blinds, and even ceilings, getting into every crook and crevice of the home. Dyson air purifiers, fans, and heaters After perfecting its vacuum technology, Dyson delved deep into the world of air purifiers, fans, heaters, and even stylish devices that can accomplish all three. With a focus as much on elegant design as functionality, Dyson air purifiers, fans, and heaters are characterized by their fanless designs, which are safe to use in homes with kids or pets because they do not have blades. Rather, air circulates using Dyson's Air Multiplier technology. The Purifier Hot+Cool line can sense pollutants in the air and capture gases and particles, destroying bacteria so you can breathe easier. One model even detects and destroys harmful formaldehyde. You can keep track of stats and air filter life using the intuitive app. If you just want cooling or heating, Dyson also has dedicated fans and heaters, from small desktop ones for personal cooling in your home office or bedroom to larger units that can cool or heat bigger spaces, like the basement or living room. Dyson also offers models with humidifying features so you can add humidity to an otherwise dry room or area. The great thing about Dyson's air purifiers, fans, and heaters is that you can use many of them all year 'round by simply switching the function to accommodate the air and temperature in your home as needed. Dyson hair care Dyson's newest product category is in the hair care space, promising to reinvent home hair care. Providing salon-like results, these devices are not only stylish themselves, but are also super simple to use. The Airwrap Styler comes with a variety of accessories to accommodate all hair types and desired styles and doesn't need to clamp onto luscious locks. The best part? It can be used while your hair is still wet, both styling and drying at the same time. The Supersonic hair dryer, which comes in three finish options, measures air temperature 20 times per second to help prevent extreme heat damage while also keeping your hair shiny for a jaw-dropping final result. For those who like to straighten their hair but hate how difficult and time-consuming it can be, the Dyson Corrale is easy to use and has unique flexing plates to prevent your hair from breaking or getting frizzy. A temperature sensor helps maintain the heat level and you can customize it to your liking, viewing everything on the built-in OLED screen. Since it's cordless, you also get up to 30 minutes of styling time per charge – long enough to straighten a full head of hair. From keeping your home's surfaces and air clean to primping yourself for a night out, Dyson has you covered. The company's decades of research and focus on perfecting every product before bringing it to market means you'll be impressed with every product, and the results you get from it.
