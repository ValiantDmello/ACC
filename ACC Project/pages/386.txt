Over the years, though, they've become much more affordable and increasingly common in modern households, as more and more people benefit from everything that laser printers bring to the table. Interested in learning more about them? Let's answer the most common questions about laser printers to help you make the decision that best suits your needs. What is a laser printer and how does it work? A laser printer uses non-impact photocopier technology to create a digital image through static electricity. A laser beam draws an image onto a revolving drum, which is rolled through toner that sticks to the charged areas. The toner is then transferred onto paper and fused with heat and pressure, all at an incredibly fast speed. The result: high-quality, smudge-free printouts with sharp, precise text. What are the benefits of a laser printer and why should I get one over an inkjet? Laser printers sport a number of useful benefits that'll make your printing experience very efficient, productive, and cost-effective in the long run. These include: High-speed printing Laser printers are generally much faster at churning out documents than inkjet printers. You'll especially notice the difference when printing out a super-lengthy document or when you've got a high volume of documents to get through. Precision and sharpness Laser printers produce very precise, razor-sharp documents that are smudge-free and more professional-looking. They also handle small fonts and fine lines better than inkjet printers. So if you mainly print text with occasional graphics, a laser printer is the way to go. Quiet operation and compact design Quieter than most inkjet printers, laser printers can be placed in a more central location in your home or office without disturbing people nearby. What's more, many laser printers are compact enough to fit in almost any space. Long-term cost effectiveness Buying a laser printer used to be an expensive proposition, but that’s no longer the case. Both colour and monochrome (black and white) laser printers cost considerably less than they used to. Plus, they last a long time and require the toner to be replaced less often than inkjet cartridges, which saves you money in the long term. What should I consider when shopping for a laser printer? Here are a few other key points to keep in mind when choosing a laser printer: Types of laser printers One important thing to decide is whether to go for a monochrome or colour laser printer. If you mainly print text documents, monochrome will more than suffice. Beyond that, you'll also want to decide whether to go with a single-function or multifunction (all-in-one) laser printer. The latter allows you to not only print, but also copy, scan and fax. Connectivity features Many laser printers have WiFi connectivity, allowing you to easily connect it to your home network without having to deal with any wires. Not only that, it gives you the ultimate convenience of being able to remotely print from your compatible smartphone or tablet, thanks to AirPrint or Google Cloud Print compatibility. Certain laser printers even let you email documents directly to the printer. If your computer isn't WiFi-compatible, make sure you get a laser printer that offers a wired connection such as a USB or Ethernet port. Want more info?
