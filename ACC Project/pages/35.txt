Google mobile phones, accessories, and more Google has been licensing its Android OS to other phone manufacturers for some time and continues to do so while also offering its own line of mobile phones under the Pixel sub-brand. With new Google products like the Google Pixel 6 and unique features like Google Lens, Night Sight, and Group Selfie, Pixel phones are a premium yet affordable option to consider. They rub on a clean, stock Android OS plus offer full integration with all the popular Google services you know and love like Google Assistant, Maps, AR, AI, along with access to the Google Store. Complement a new Google phone with authentic Google branded accessories, from adapters and charging cables to protective cases, wireless chargers like the Pixel Stand. And keep your hands free for calls or while listening to music with a pair of Google Pixel earbuds to complete the set-up. Google computing and networking Another big area of growth for Google is computing and networking, including everything from ChromeOS-based Google tablets to Chromebooks like the Google Pixelbook. These offer a seamless, cloud-based Google experience using the Chrome browser with access to all Google features in a lightweight, compact, easy-to-use design at an affordable price. With some models, you can use the convenient Pixelbook Pen for taking notes, sketching, navigating websites, and more. Google devices can also help you stay connected at home, including the line of Wi-Fi mesh networking products for whole-home wireless along with Wi-Fi routers. Google Assistant devices, meanwhile, can be controlled via voice commands for effortless operation. Google for the smart home Google products for the home start with smart speakers and displays, including the Google Nest Hub, Google Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, and Google Nest Audio smart speaker. While those function as the central hub of the home controlling other smart devices, playing music, reporting the weather and traffic, answering “Hey, Google” queries, and more, there are other products worth considering to work alongside them. Home security, for example, is taken care of with Google Nest Wi-Fi video doorbells and indoor/outdoor security cameras. Meanwhile, keep an eye on safety in the home with Google Nest smart thermostat, smoke and carbon monoxide alarm, and temperature sensor. For entertainment, the Google Chromecast is the perfect way to wirelessly "cast" video from a mobile device to the big screen so the entire family can enjoy. Upgrade to the Google Chromecast Ultra with a compatible TV and enjoy the experience in full 4K HDR quality.
