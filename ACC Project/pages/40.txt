The only thing is, traditional desktop computers tend to take up quite a bit of space. If you like the idea of having a desktop PC but don’t have much space to work with, an all-in-one computer may be the perfect solution for you. Read on to find out the answers to the most common questions about all-in-one PCs to see if they’re the right choice for you and to help you find the one that best suits your needs. What is an all-in-one computer? All-in-one PCs differ from regular desktop computers in that they have all their internal components integrated into one unit that also acts as a large display. This gives you a compact design that makes them ideal for desktops with limited space. All-in-one PCs can handle most of your computing tasks, and often come equipped with wireless connectivity like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you’ll only need one cable to make it all work. What are the main benefits of an all-in-one computer? All-in-one computers feature a number of key benefits that give them an advantage over traditional desktop computers. Boasts an attractive design and frees up desktop space All-in-one PCs tend to feature a sleeker, more attractive design than computer towers. Bulky desktop PCs often take away from an office décor, while a clean, streamlined all-in-one can make a really nice addition to your workstation. What’s more, thanks to their compact design, they take up much less desktop space than your average desktop PC, giving you more room for to work with. Saves you the trouble of buying a monitor Another big advantage to all-in-one PCs is that everything’s included so you don’t have to go out and buy a separate monitor. Technology has gotten to a point where screens have become thin enough that all of a computer’s components, with the exception of peripherals like scanners and printers, can now be built into the display. The result is a convenient, centralized unit that saves you the hassle of going on a separate shop for a monitor. Easy to set up and very user-friendly Another reason people love all-in-one PCs is because of how easy it is to get them up and running. With so much built into one single unit, all you have to do is take an all-in-one PC out of the box, plug it in along with a keyboard and mouse, and you can start using it right away. All-in-one computers require fewer wires than computer towers, which makes setup so easy, minimizes cable clutter, and gives your desktop a clean, organized look. How do I know if an all-in-one PC is right for me? Before you decide on going with an all-in-one, you’ll want to make sure it’s the right fit for you. With their large screens, all-in-one PCs are obviously not portable like laptops. That said, their centralized design and fewer wires still make them easier to relocate than tower PCs. If you’re a serious gamer or need a computer to do heavy-duty, demanding tasks, an all-in-one PC may not be the most suitable choice for you. That said, if you’re looking for a PC that offers a large flat screen, saves you precious desktop space, and provides plenty of power to handle most of your computing tasks, an all-in-one computer is certainly a great option. What should I consider before buying an all-in-one computer? When shopping for an all-in-one PC, screen size is one of the most important things to consider. In terms of size, it’s a good idea to go for one that’s at least 23”, which generally gives you at least true 1080p HD resolution and also gives you the convenience of seeing multiple pages onscreen at once. You’ll also want to decide whether or not to go with a touchscreen all-in-one PC, which basically depends solely on your personal preferences and tendencies. In terms of internal specs, though it largely depends on what you’re hoping to get out of your computer, choosing an all-in-one PC with a quad-core processor with at least 6GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive will give you the flexibility to get a lot of different types of tasks done efficiently for a very enjoyable computing experience. All-in-one PCs are just one type of desktop computer available at Best Buy. You can also find an impressive selection of other desktop computers from great brands such as HP, ASUS, Dell, and Lenovo.
