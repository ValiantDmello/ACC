Can you use a stylus on any tablet? Stylus pens for tablets have been around since the first tablet hit the market. Any tablet can use a capacitive stylus. This is a stylus with a tip that’s specially treated to mimic the effect of human skin, making it compatible with any touchscreen tablet. A capacitive stylus lacks the features of more advanced, powered styluses, and won’t be as accurate as some (think of it as a replacement for your finger), but it has the advantages of being inexpensive and not requiring batteries. What are the different uses of a tablet stylus? A tablet stylus has many uses. For people with large fingers and/or tablets with small displays, a stylus can make everyday navigation and data entry on a tablet more accurate. Where these accessories really stand out is when they are used with a tablet as a replacement for pen (or pencil) and paper. A tablet drawing stylus is used by artists to create and edit digital art on their tablet. Software can make a stylus replicate the action of everything from a pencil to a paint brush. A stylus is key to getting the most out of tablets and apps that support handwriting recognition, like Windows Ink. A stylus can be used to take notes, which many people find more convenient than typing. A tablet stylus can also be used as a highlighter, marking up digital content. Does a Bamboo stylus work on any tablet or iPad? Bamboo styluses are made by Wacom. Some models are designed to be used with specific tablets, while the company also released capacitive styluses that can be used with any tablet or iPad. To make certain a Bamboo stylus is compatible with your tablet (and what features it supports), check the product description. Compatibility and types of stylus Styluses started simple, but have become much more capable as manufacturers have added features to support specific platforms. You can always count on a capacitive stylus to work with any tablet, but from there things get a little more complicated—while delivering far more in terms of interactive features. Apple Pencil is the company’s own iPad stylus. It is now on its second generation, offering features like wireless charging, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and magnetic connectivity. This iPad stylus pen is not compatible with other tablets, and each version of the Apple Pencil may only be used with specific iPad models. Another popular choice is the Microsoft Surface Pen. When used with compatible Surface tablets and devices, it offers high end features like 4,06 pressure points, a digital eraser, optional replacement stylus tips, shading, and support for Windows Ink Editor. Many tablet and 2-in-1 PC makers offer their own device-specific stylus, and there are also well-known third party companies like Wacom, Insignia, and Adonit that sell a range of styluses. When in doubt, check the stylus product description. You want to verify that it supports your specific device, and what features it supports.
