And you can browse through tons of great options to find the right one to suit your mood and likes. Get help deciding what to watch if you’re having a hard time choosing, or expand your tastes by finding something new that you might not ever have considered watching or listening to before. Music is available in a variety of genres, like dance, country, rock, metal, gospel, jazz, children’s, reggae, classic, and even karaoke for a sing-along party. And you might even be able to find some rare albums. Movies, meanwhile, come in every genre imaginable, from dramas to comedies, sci-fi, horror, animated, and more. You can also get full seasons of classic and current TV series across various genres. There are bilingual titles that include both French and English languages. What formats can you get movies and music in? Movies come in a variety of formats, including DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD Blu-ray discs. You can buy individual titles on disc, titles in combo packs that include informative SteelBooks, or multi-film or season collections for movies and TV series, respectively. You can get, for example, a collection of various Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, or a box set of the entire series of Game of Thrones. With music, formats include CD, vinyl, or downloads. Like movies, you can buy individual titles on disc or vinyl, or grab sets that can range from two disc/records up to 14 or 15 in a set showcasing a particular concert pianist, for example. Music is available from single artists and music bands, and also includes a selection of movie/TV show soundtracks, or greatest hits and essentials compilations. The selection includes current musicians like Ed Sheeran and Lady Gaga, as well as those from decades past, like Weezer and Alanis, and artists who have become musical icons, like Sammy Davis Jr., Metallica, and Bob Marley. How can you shop for movies and music? It’s easy to search for movies and music by a number of parameters, including genre, price, exclusives, brand/studio, or format. Browse what’s on sale if you’re looking for some affordable new finds; you might come across something you’ve been meaning to check out or had heard about but hadn’t yet immersed yourself in. Or, look through by status to find just-released titles, including an album a favourite artist just dropped or movie that has just left theatres. You can also see what’s available for pre-order and be among the first to get your hands on a highly-coveted music CD, vinyl, or movie or TV series season release.
