Foyer and entryway furniture is the first thing you see when walking into a home, and an important part of the décor. But most importantly, it provides a tidy place for storing essentials like jackets, hats, scarves, gloves, shoes, umbrella, purse, wallet, keys, and more you need to grab and go, keeping the front hallway organized, devoid of clutter. Foyer and entryway furniture can also display items like books and magazines; or decorative vases and lamps. Different types of foyer and entryway furniture Foyer and entryway furniture come in various shapes, sizes, and , and made from materials like wood, MDF, and metal. Larger items accommodate multiple essentials, while smaller pieces for specific things, or just one or two people. Designs range from traditional to modern and contemporary. With some, a mirror lets you get a last quick check before walking out the door. Hall trees are tall and narrow pieces of furniture that typically include a row of hooks for hanging items, like jackets and scarves, as well as a compartment for shoes. Designed to sit against a wall or in a corner, many have notch cut-outs at the base to accommodate baseboards. Some might even have a built-in bench for sitting down while you put on your shoes. Positioned on the wall, wall-mounted coat racks are rectangular, with hooks, and often cubbies up top for holding essentials like your wallet and keys, or for decorative pieces. There’s no storage for shoes. Coat racks are tall, tree-like structures with hooks at the top for holding jackets, scarves, and other lightweight items. Some look like a tree, or they can be square or triangular in shape. They are ideally suited to smaller families or single persons who only need somewhere to put a few jackets, or those not looking for an area for keys or shoes. An entryway bench is low, rectangular furniture for storing shoes, baskets, or decorative pieces, either in divided cubbies or open space underneath. The top is sturdy enough for you to sit on and use it as an ottoman as well. There are long or single size for accommodating one person and one or two pairs of shoes. There are also shelves exclusively for shoes, wall shelves for small and lightweight items, and entryway tables for your purse, keys, books, and decorative items. How to choose the right foyer and entryway furniture Consider how many people are in your home, and what items are a priority to store (e.g. keys so you don’t misplace them, multiple jackets, lots of shoes, or all of the above). Then ask yourself if it will predominantly be serving a specific functional purpose, or if the priority is to make a good first impression of the home. Chances are, it will be a bit of both.
