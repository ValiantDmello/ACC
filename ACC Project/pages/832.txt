Have you ever tried watching a video online, but it pauses every six seconds to buffer? The solution to this frustrating scenario may be as simple as upgrading your graphics card. Whether you’re gaming online or streaming videos, a video card can make a big impact on your computer’s performance. Best Buy offers a range of high-speed AMD Radeon and NVIDIA-based graphics technologies from manufacturers like ASUS, EVGA, Sapphire, and Zotac. A video (or graphics) card enables your computer to process images. Video cards are often described as being integrated or dedicated. An integrated graphics card has only a small amount of embedded memory, and mainly relies on the system's RAM, which reduces the total RAM available. This is usually less ideal since it can slow down your computer. A dedicated graphics card, however, uses its own RAM and processor that are specifically designed for processing video images. Since it does not use the system’s resources, it won't slow down your computer. Improving speed in other areas Graphics cards are great for improving detail and increasing the speed of programs such as Photoshop, PowerPoint, Keynote, and others. It also facilitates image editing software, especially with editing high-resolution images. Without a powerful enough graphics card, you will be waiting for your computer to render every time you make an adjustment. Whether you’re playing videos, making edits, or saving files, everything will run faster. How do I upgrade my PC graphics card? This relatively slim piece of hardware can be slotted into one of the expansion ports in your computer. Installation is fairly straightforward – simply refer to the instructions provided with the device. Once the hardware is installed into your motherboard or CPU, your operating system should automatically detect the new device and prompt you through the necessary steps to install the software. If not, you may have to run the installation CD that comes with your device. Once in place, you will be enjoying smoother graphics and faster processing. Want More Info?
