Established in 1910 as a producer of gramophones and records, Denon quickly built a reputation for innovation, craftsmanship, and the pursuit of audio perfection. There’s a reason the company’s philosophy is “Passion, Artistry, and Technology.” That drive has resulted in many industry firsts, including the introduction of CDs in 1984, and the world’s first 13.2 channel AV receiver in 2018. Along the way, a major milestone was reached in 1971 when the company began selling separate hi-fi audio components including Denon speakers, amplifiers, turntables and tuners. In 1988 the lineup was expanded to include AV receivers, a category for which Denon is now a world leader. Denon receivers For exceptional home theatre and music listening performance, start with a Denon receiver. Denon offers a wide range of A/V receivers with options for every budget. Not everyone needs 13.2 channel IMAX Enhanced audio with 150W on tap, but if you do, Denon has you covered. The same philosophy of “Passion, Artistry, and Technology” that applies to its flagship is found throughout the entire Denon receiver line. Look for the latest technology including Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, integrated voice control, AirPlay 2 and Wi-Fi connectivity, integrated Spotify streaming, eARC HDMI and Dynamic Volume. Even an entry level model from Denon Canada includes features like 5.2 channel Dolby TrueHD audio with automatic speaker setup, Bluetooth connectivity, and compatibility with both Alexa and Google Assistant. Denon turntables Denon got its start with phonographs and record players before introducing its own phono cartridges and turntables. That heritage is on full display with the current lineup of Denon turntables, including the flagship DP-450USB. This beautifully minimalist belt-drive turntable features a built-in phono equalizer for use with wireless speakers and mini stereo systems, one-touch USB digitization of record tracks, and a high quality Denon DSN-85 cartridge pre-mounted. Denon speakers Some people prefer to enjoy their music on a set of premium Denon headphones, but to get the full experience of hearing music the way it’s played—sound reverberating through a room full of people—you need Denon speakers. The company has embraced the future, with a compelling line of HEOS wireless speakers that fill your home with premium audio without the tangle of cables. They feature powerful Class D amplifiers, custom drivers, sophisticated enclosures, and Alexa voice control. Paired with a Denon amplifier or receiver, streaming audio has never sounded better. Add a wireless HEOS subwoofer for an upgrade to room shaking bass. For portable audio, Denon’s Envaya wireless speakers offer super-sized sound in a compact, water resistant package. HEOS: the best way to experience streaming multi-room audio HEOS (or Home Entertainment operating System) is Denon’s wireless, multi-room audio streaming platform with support for all the major formats (such as MP3, WMA and AAC) in addition to audiophile quality, lossless audio files including WAV, ALAC and FLAC. With a HEOS-equipped Denon receiver or your smartphone running the free HEOS mobile app, you can effortlessly stream high resolution audio to any HEOS wireless speaker on your network—including a Denon HEOS soundbar. If you value high quality audio performance, you’ll love Denon receivers, components, and HEOS wireless speakers.
