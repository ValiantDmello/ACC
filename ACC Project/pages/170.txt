Whether you have an Instant Pot Viva, Instant Pot Duo, or Instant Pot Ultra, you get a multi-cooker that does the job of a slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, pressure cooker, and more. How is an instant pot different from a pressure cooker? An Instant Pot may be called a pressure cooker, but the two appliances are not one in the same. While a pressure cooker will work on your stove and pressure cooker meat or vegetables, an Instant Pot is a stand-alone small appliance that uses pre-set menu options to cook meat, vegetables, eggs, rice, and even cake. What are the main benefits of an Instant Pot? An Instant Pot will be your most-used small appliance. Because you can put your ingredients in the pot and hit a button to cook them, you’ll never burn or over-cook your food. Everything you put in the Instant Pot turns out moist, tender, and cooked to perfection. You don’t have to watch over your food while cooking either. Because the Instant Pot pressure cooker is a sealed device, it will turn off when your cook time is up. You can choose whether to have it turn off completely or keep your food warm until you’re ready to eat. Sautéing and browning is also an option with the Instant Pot. Instead of getting multiple pots and pans dirty, you can just use one small appliance to cook your entire meal. What is the best thing to cook in instant pot? While the Instant Pot will cook everything from yogurt to chicken, many home chefs agree the best thing to cook in an Instant Pot is pot roast. The Instant Pot will cook your roast in half the time, you can add vegetables and make gravy right in the pot, and it will be cooked exactly the way you like it. Beyond pot roast, Instant Pot users rave about how easy it is to cook rice, mashed potatoes, orange chicken, and butter chicken in their pressure cooker too. What’s the best Instant Pot for you? There are a number of different Instant pot pressure cookers available. While each works the essentially the same way, different Instant Pots have different capacities. Depending on which you purchase, there will also be a variety of menu options. Instant Pot Max The Instant Pot Max is the top-of-the-line Instant Pot. It offers 15 pounds per square inch of pressure inside the device for even, easy cooking. It has a touch-screen for easy menu selection, power-connected lid for agitated cooking, and six-quart size.
