We’ve got energy-saving LED TVs, Smart TVs for streaming online content, 4K TVs for ultra-high definition viewing and next-gen OLED TVs for spectacular picture quality. Here are some general considerations when looking for a TV that’ll suit your lifestyle and entertainment needs. Picture Quality Screen resolution contributes to the level of detail that appears on the screen, along with brightness, contrast and colour. The two resolution numbers measure picture elements left to right of the screen and top to bottom, respectively. Full HD, for example, displays 1920 x 1080 pixels, or a 1080p top-to-bottom resolution. Ultra-high definition (UHD) displays 3840 x 2160 pixels, more commonly known as 4K. 4K TVs offer spectacular picture quality, delivering more pixels than HDTV or high-end 1080p LED screens, more realistic colour and higher frame rates. A 4K UHD TV can upscale non-4K content by filling in the missing pixels, so your favourite shows, movies and games will look better than ever. For example, with Sony BRAVIA XR TVs everything you watch becomes more detailed and immersive with true-to-life 4K HDR, powered by the all-new Cognitive Processor XR. High Dynamic Range (HDR) UHD 4K TVs give you around 4 times better resolution than Full HD displays, but perhaps the biggest benefit of 4K TVs is that they're able to include High Dynamic Range (HDR) technology. HDR gives a TV the ability to showcase visuals with brighter, more intense colours, making the images look much more realistic. With HDR you'll get colours that pop and vibrant visuals that make you feel like you're actually there. Just don't forget to blink. Smart TVs and Media Streamers Connect a Smart TV to the internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet and you'll have instant access to an incredibly wide selection of online sources, including movies, TV shows, games, social media sites, and more. With so much internet-based content available many "cord cutters" have dropped their TV cable service and gone online-only. If you want to add Smart TV functionality to your current, non-internet connected TV, you can pick up a media streamer like Apple TV, Chromecast, or Roku. These devices plug into your TV and connect to the internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet, effectively turning your television into a Smart TV. Screen Size In this case, the bigger the screen size the better for your viewing pleasure, budget and space permitting. A wider and taller TV screen allows you to appreciate the finer details in HD content. If you’re sitting eight to 10 feet away from the screen, a 46- to 55-inch tv will do wonders. For more intimate viewing in your bedroom, kitchen or office nook, opt for screens between 26 and 32 inches. You can select by TV sizes to optimize your space well. Remote Controls A remote control is simply a cordless, rectangular thing with buttons, right? Not anymore. Many modern TVs come with remotes that include new, cutting-edge technologies like touchpads or gesture controls. You can even get remotes that accept voice commands -- just say what you want and the TV will respond. FAQ 1. What’s the difference between LED and OLED? LED TVs use a backlighting system of light-emitting diode (LED) light bulbs, which consume less energy and last longer. As a result, LED TVs deliver crystal-clear picture whether you’re watching a movie with the lights off or catching the morning news in a sun-soaked living room. OLED TVs deliver incredible contrast, razor-sharp clarity and wide viewing angles for spectacular images that’ll blow you away. Each pixel is a small organic light-emitting diode, eliminating the need for backlighting and allowing for a super-slim and energy-efficient design. 2. What is a curved TV good for? If you want to go really deep into your entertainment then perhaps a curved TV is for you. The curved screen design helps to increase immersion by wrapping the image around your field of view, giving you more of a sense of depth. And let's face it -- they look pretty darned cool, even when the screen is turned off. 3. Should I get a projector for my home theatre? For a larger-than-life cinematic experience from the comfort of your own couch, a home theatre projector will do the trick. Imagine a screen that could fill your entire field of view for truly immersive viewing. You can also save space mounting the projector on the ceiling and the screen on the wall. Want more info?
