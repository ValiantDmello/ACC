After launching Mini versions over the last two years, this one now stands out as the more wieldy of the duo. It comes with a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display—the same size as that of the iPhone 14 Pro. Unlike that model, however, this one keeps the notch at the top housing the TrueDepth camera. It doesn’t have the Dynamic Island introduced in the 14 Pro and Pro Max devices. Despite that, it’s still a sturdy phone courtesy of the Ceramic Shield glass protecting the vibrant display. Even if you put a screen protector on to add another layer of protection, you can expect to see the same colour and contrast that makes iOS look rich. Similar to previous iPhone models you get the option to connect to your wireless carrier’s services using a physical SIM card or the eSIM functionality which is embedded in the phone. There is also satellite connectivity through the Emergency SOS feature, enabling a way to contact someone when there’s no reception.* It’s an added safety measure, particularly when in remote locations with no other modes of communication. Crash Detection is yet another safety feature, notifying emergency response if you’re unresponsive after a vehicle collision.** Tweaking the camera Apple gave the camera a few updates, starting with the new 12-megapixel image sensor and wider f/1.5 aperture. The Photonic Engine software does the legwork in the background to improve low-light photos by capturing several shots all at once and merging them together for the best image. You can expect better quality from the 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens as well, as there is no telephoto lens in this phone, like there is in the Pro models. It also gets more creative to record video footage with the new Action mode, which adds greater stability to the content you’re capturing. Instead of shaky footage, you can follow a subject or scene on foot and see it come out smooth. Cinematic mode also gets a filmmaker’s flair with new support for 4K resolution at 24fps, the same frame rate you see in movies and TV shows. When it comes time to put the camera on yourself, the new TrueDepth camera reduces the time it takes to focus, making it easier to take quicker selfies. That improved focusing also shows itself when doing video calls on FaceTime and other apps. Staying on, standing out The iPhone 14 runs on the same Apple A15 Bionic processor first introduced in the iPhone 13 devices. It’s capable of pushing this phone through any set of tasks and enables it to run smoothly, no matter what it is you want to do. Whether it’s consuming content, playing games, editing video, or learning something new, the iPhone 14 is built to handle it. Plus, it also brings in all the best features from iOS 16. It's compatible with all MagSafe chargers and accessories, so you don’t have to abandon them when they can still work. There is a growing number of cases, charging pads, docks, camera accessories and much more supporting it. Some colour options also stand out, with Apple offering the phone in five different shades. The iPhone 14 comes in midnight, starlight, blue, purple, and Product Red. Product disclaimer *Emergency SOS via Satellite: Available in November 2022.
