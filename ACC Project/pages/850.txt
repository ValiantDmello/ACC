The Mac mini is loaded with all the power, ports, and performance of every Apple computer, so when you pick one up from your local Best Buy, you can be sure that you’re taking home a pint-sized powerhouse that will take on any task. The Mac mini measures just 19.7 cm square, and 3.6 cm tall, so it will fit just about anywhere. There’s no power brick either, just a cord. Because of its diminutive size and affordable price, the Mac mini is ideal as a compact desktop PC or a multimedia server. It shines where you need a powerful computing option in a small space. It also delivers the macOS experience in a package where you bring your own favourite keyboard, mouse, and monitor. The all-new Apple Mac mini In November 2020, Apple introduced an all-new Mac mini. Powered by the new Apple M1 processor, the Mac mini runs macOS Big Sur. The new Mac mini can be equipped with 8GB or 16GB of RAM, and SSD storage options ranging from 256GB to 2TB. It still offers all the ports that power users have come to appreciate: 2 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3/USB 4), 2 x USB Type-A (USB 3.1), HDMI 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, and a headphone jack. This mighty mini can drive two displays simultaneously, one at up to 6K resolution over USB-C, and a second at 4K over the HDMI 2.0 port. What’s different compared to the previous version? Visually, you’ll have a hard time telling the new Apple Mac mini from previous versions. The same sleek block of aluminum, a similarly generous selection of ports. The main difference is the use of Apple’s revolutionary eight-core M1 processor instead of Intel CPUs. This single change makes a massive difference in performance. The new Mac mini delivers up three times faster CPU performance, graphics that are up to six times faster, and a Neural Engine that makes machine learning up to 15 times faster. Wireless connectivity is also faster, thanks to an upgrade to Wi-Fi 6. The move to the M1 processor (which uses unified memory) does mean that maximum RAM is limited to 16GB in the new Mac mini. Unlike the previous versions that used Intel processors, that RAM can’t be replaced or upgraded. The new Apple Mac mini also has two fewer USB-C ports than its Intel predecessor (two vs, four in the Intel model). For those who prefer an Intel processor and RAM upgradability, Apple is continuing to offer that version along with the new M1 Mac Mini. Either way, you get a lot of computers in an impressively compact package. Want more info about Apple computers?
