Nothing exemplifies this more than the flagship Spectre x360 series, which melds stunning industrial design, power, performance and a flexible convertible design. HP also offers a wide range of laptops aimed at home and business use including the popular EliteBook and ProBook lines, offering slim form factors, beautiful displays, long battery life and the power needed to maximize productivity. For mobile gaming, PC gamers know that nothing beats the experience of playing on a high-performance HP Omen laptop. Students and parents can count on HP’s Chromebooks for the best Google Chrome experience, with a compelling combination of high-quality hardware and affordable pricing. HP Desktop Computers No matter what form factor you prefer—tower, all-in-one, or mini—HP desktop computers offer the power, ports and expandability you need. If you’ve worked in an office, you’ve undoubtedly seen rows of HP computers in use. They’ve been popular with IT departments for decades because they deliver the complete package: the power needed to get work done out of the box, expandability, and reliability. HP Pavilion and OMEN gaming desktops are the top choice for gamers and esports athletes, with bold designs, cutting edge LED lighting, the latest Intel Core CPUs, powerful Nvidia graphics cards and high-tech cooling systems. Families, students and anyone who wants the power of a desktop PC but has limited space, love HP’s stylish all-in-one PCs. Big, high resolution displays (some of them touch-enabled) conceal powerful components for the performance you need while taking up minimal space on your desk. HP Monitors The perfect companion for any computer is an HP monitor. Models are available in a range of screen sizes and resolutions up to 4K UHD. All the latest display technology is available, including curved screens, IPS panels, micro-edge bezels and AMD FreeSync. No matter which HP monitor you choose, you’ll appreciate the crisp text, bright and realistic colours, plug-and-play ease with a wide range of connectivity standards supported, and stands that are designed to ensure you always have the perfect view. HP Printers HP is the company that released the world’s first desktop laser printer, so it’s no surprise that this printing pioneer continues to lead the industry. HP’s LaserJet line (in black and white, and colour) still sets the standard for desktop laser printers, while its OfficeJet inkjet printers offer the ability to print photorealistic images and high quality documents. Choose from standalone and all-in-one models that are ideal for home office and small business use. While you can still connect with a USB cable, HP printers support a wide range of wireless printing options as well. HP’s portable Sprocket portable photo printers are on the cutting edge of mobile printing technology. And for those who dread buying ink refills, HP’s Instant Ink program automates the ordering process and gives you all the prints you need for a low monthly fee.
