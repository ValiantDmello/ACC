Sonos is known for its Sonos PLAY and Sonos ONE lineup of wireless home audio, and the speakers can be programmed to use together, playing music in rooms all over your house, or separately, streaming tunes and podcasts to individual speakers. Sonos wireless speakers are AC powered, but don’t need speaker wire to connect to your home theatre, they use Wi-Fi for stronger streaming and faster connections. And you can control your entire Sonos ecosystem with the Sonos app on your phone or using your voice and the power of Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. You can find a huge array of products from Sonos Canada at Best Buy. Sonos Sound Bars and Sound Base Sonos has evolved from making small compact speakers to outfitting entire home theatres with rich, vibrant audio. Sonos sound bars are specifically tuned by Oscar-winning sound engineers to emphasize the sound of the human voice so you can always follow what’s unfolding on your TV. Sonos makes a variety of options for getting top quality sound from your TV, whether you need a traditional sound bar, a smart sound bar, or something that you can sit your TV on top of, like the uniquely designed Playbase sound base. Sonos Amps and Subs Sonos has everything you need to complete your home theatre. Start with a Sonos amplifier to bring the Sonos experience to your floor-standing, in-wall, in-ceiling, outdoor, and bookshelf speakers. Connect everything from your turntable and stereo to even your wired speakers to a Sonos amplifier enjoy vinyl, CDs, digital audio files, and streaming. When it comes to getting just the right bass level, a Sonos subwoofer is specially built to eliminate vibration and rattle so all you hear is pure bass. Sonos subwoofers are versatile too; stand it upright or lay it on its side. You can even tuck it under the sofa. Sonos Architectural, Built-in and Outdoor Speakers Want a setup that is discrete? Sonos makes built-in or architectural speakers and components for both indoors and outdoors. Sonos Architectural speakers can be flush mounted in the ceiling or walls for all the ultra-high quality audio you need, without the need to find space to place traditional speakers. When you want the best quality home theatre audio, that’s versatile enough to expand over the whole house and a system that’s got a no-fuss interface, choose Sonos.
