(Or, at least, since 1946.) It sneaks around the edges of everyone’s lives: maybe you didn’t start out looking for a Casio in particular, but that’s exactly what you ended up with. Whether your first Casio was a watch, an electric keyboard, or one of their many calculators, it’s hard to find a household that hasn’t been touched by this brand in some way. If you want a challenge, try finding a calculator in your daily life that isn’t a Casio. They’re one of the top brands both in the household and in the workplace, so it can sometime be quite tough to find one from anyone else! The brand offers desktop printing calculators, graphing calculators, and yes: even basic solar powered calculators. Extra Durable Casio G-Shock Men’s Watches Casio G-Shock watches are, perhaps, the most recognizable brand in Casio’s portfolio. The G-Shock is iconic: each of these men’s watches is large and heavily protected, with a rugged exterior made from the brand’s easily identifiable resin. With extreme water resistance (look to Casio G-Shock for water resistance around the 200 metre mark) and a shock resistant design, G-Shock watches are a popular choice for kids and for anyone who works in the field. Classic Casio Watches (and More) If the G-Shock is too bulky of a style move for you, don’t fret: Casio classic watches are another great option from the brand. Many of their watch designs are solar-powered, just like their calculators—and some even have a mini calculator built right in to the watch face! For a vintage look, Casio’s rectangular gold and silver watches are a design that’s been with the brand for decades. The brand also offers smartwatches that are a little more “rough and tumble” than what you’d get from your typical fashion brand. Look at their Pro Trek styles for their latest in smart technology, from route tracking to ambient temperature. Casio Pro Trek smartwatches are a blend between a simple smartwatch and the brand’s G-Shock line; with resin casing and light water resistance, they’re designed for durability. Casio Electric Keyboards Calculators and watches aside, Casio still has one infamous category left: the Casio electric keyboard. These keyboards are lightweight and easy to store and transport, making each design excellent for the travelling musician or new learner on a budget. For a higher quality of sound, Casio’s digital pianos mimic the sound and feel of an acoustic piano. They have fully weighted keys, separate foot pedal accompaniments, and a richer sound that’s closer to that a full-bodied piano. Keep an eye out for Casio products in your home, whether they’re musical, mathematical, or simply stylish. Chances are, your household has relied on one for years already.
