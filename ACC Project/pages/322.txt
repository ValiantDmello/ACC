The rest is history. In 1988, Whirlpool acquired a 53% stake in the large appliance division of Philips N.V., making it the world’s largest manufacturer of major appliances (the company went on to purchase the rest of Philips in 1991). Today, Whirlpool appliances are available for every room of the home, and the company gives back, too, including serving as a principal supporter of Habitat for Humanity. Whirlpool Washing Machines Whirlpool washing machines come in a range of sizes, from 1.9 up to 8.8 cubic feet, and in modern and elegant finishes like white, cashmere, chrome shadow, and chrome. High efficiency, electric, and steam designs include top and front load, as well as stacked or side-by-side with a matching dryer, and combo units. Boasting anywhere from 12 to an impressive 37 wash cycles, many machines have features like a presoak option, deep water wash, and vibration reduction. A built-in steam function helps get tough stains out, while some models offer multiple water levels and up to five water temperature settings. A Load and Go dispenser stores enough detergent for up to 40 loads. Adaptive Wash technology with Active Bloom, another core feature, automatically adjusts water levels and wash action based on the load; while Active Spray technology sprays fabrics with water and detergent in a cone-shaped pattern. The smooth wave stainless steel wash basket is gentle on your clothes to prevent damage from snags or fraying. Whirlpool Refrigerators From full-sized 24” up to 36” refrigerators, along with upright freezers, chest freezers, and wine coolers/cellars, Whirlpool has your refrigeration needs covered. Whirlpool refrigerators come in every style imaginable, from French door to side-by-side, bottom or top freezers, with ice/water dispensers, and in modern and fingerprint-resistant finishes like stainless steel, white, black, black stainless, or bronze. LED lighting is found in many models, along with Accu-Chill temperature management to keep the interior at an optimal temperature, FreshFlow produce preserver to keep fruits and vegetables fresher for longer, and adaptive defrost that only runs the defrost cycle when necessary. You’ll also find adjustable door bins, a full-width pantry drawer to hold larger items like a sheet cake or party tray, and spill-proof glass shelves so leaks don’t spill from one shelf to another. Whirlpool Cooktops, Ranges, and Stoves From 24” up to 30”, Whirlpool electric or gas stoves, available in the same five finishes, come with 4 or 5 elements on the stovetop, and are freestanding or slide-in with smooth or coil tops. Get the cooktops separately, too, including 30” and 31” black 4 or 5 element models. True convection models add a rear fan and third heating element, providing consistent heat for faster cooking. Double ovens let you cook two things at the same time at different temperatures. There’s also an oven/microwave combo, and many models have built-in Wi-Fi that lets you remotely preheat an oven from a smartphone or tablet, send cooking instructions, keep food warm for a party, or even receive an alert from a compatible Nest thermostat if you forgot to turn it off. Some common features include rapid preheat, frozen bake for adjusting cooking time so you can cook right from frozen, a temperature sensor, AquaLift self-clean that uses only water and low heat, and Sabbath Mode that keeps the oven dark but on Bake for days over the holidays. No matter if you’re eating dinner with just the family or entertaining lots of friends and family, Whirlpool appliances like refrigerators and stoves can meet your needs in the kitchen. Meanwhile, in the laundry room, count on a Whirlpool washer to keep your clothes clean, fresh, and ready for wear when you need them.
