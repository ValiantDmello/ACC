Whether you need a high powered, professional notebook like the MacBook Pro 15 inch, or something light and affordable like the new MacBook Air, there’s an Apple laptop that’s right for you. Apple MacBook Air In October 2018 Apple updated the MacBook Air, upgrading its internal components to an 8th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, up to 16GB of memory, and up to 1.5TB of SSD storage. The screen now features a gorgeous 13.3" Retina display and on the top right corner of the keyboard you'll find a Touch ID sensor for using your fingerprint to unlock the laptop or make purchases through Apple Pay. One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the MacBook Air's signature ultra-slim design, which is only 1.56cm at its thickest point and an amazing 0.41cm at the thinnest section. MacBook Ever since its introduction in 2015, the new Apple MacBook has continued to set the standard for thin, light, and stylish laptops. Available in Space Grey, Silver, Gold and Rose Gold aluminum, the Apple MacBook features a brilliant 12-inch Retina display, 10-hour battery life, and a high speed, multifunction USB-C port. New for 2017 are 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake CPUs (with improved speed and battery life), SSDs that are 50% faster than before, and an improved keyboard. MacBook Pro The Apple MacBook Pro remains at the top of Apple’s laptop lineup: the ideal thin, lightweight laptop for professionals. The renowned, high resolution MacBook Pro Retina display is offered across the line-up. It’s razor sharp and bright, with a high contrast ratio and a wide P3 colour range. Also offered on all MacBook Pros are a multiple high speed Thunderbolt 3-compatible USB-C ports, PCIe SSD storage, a super-sized Force Touch trackpad and 10-hour battery life. This year, Apple has upgraded the CPUs to 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processors, up to a quad-core Core i7. The MacBook Pro 13 inch models get Intel Iris Plus graphics, while the MacBook Pro 15 inch has been upgraded with new AMD Radeon Pro 555 and 560 graphics cards. The innovative OLED Touch Bar remains as a standard feature on the 15-inch model, and is an option on the MacBook Pro 13 Inch. Want more info about Apple computers?
